JPP provides a seamless referral system through: (i) replacement of email communications; (ii) allows hospital partners to make referrals; and (iii) provide care instructions with patient outcome tracking.
Mobile and digital health Our AllyCare programme is delivered through HeyAlly mobile services   HeyAlly application, providing our patients the access to: (i) medical care for acute and chronic conditions; (ii) medical advisory; and (iii) second medical opinion.

7 Same day delivery is applicable for consultations completed before 10pm.
For consultations performed after 10pm, the patient s medication will be delivered in the following day.

SUPPORTING THE TCFD We are committed to supporting the recommendations by the TCFD and disclosed our climate-related financial disclosures in the following key areas as recommended by the TCFD: Governance a. Describe the board s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.
The Board oversees the climate-related risks and opportunities and considers climate-related issues in setting the Group s strategic direction, policies and target setting.
b. Describe management s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Our sustainability strategy is developed and directed by the executive level SC in consultation with the Board.
The SC, which includes senior management executives and key managers from various functions, is led by the CEO and supported by the COO and CFO.
The responsibilities of the SC cover the areas of developing sustainability strategy and policies, implementation of sustainability strategy, monitoring and reporting of performance data, management of climate-related risks and opportunities.
45 46 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Strategy a. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified over the short, medium, and long term.
b. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation s businesses, strategy, and financial planning.
We recognise that climate change poses different types of risks to our business.
The Group s assessment on potential implication of the above climate-related risks was undertaken based on the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System ( NGFS ) range of climate scenarios: Scenario Description NGFS   Orderly This scenario assumes climate policies are introduced early and become gradually more stringent.
Both physical and transition risks are relatively subdued through cohesive stringent climate policies and innovation.
NGFS   Hot house world This scenario assumes that some climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but global efforts are insufficient to halt significant global warming.
Critical temperature thresholds are exceeded, leading to severe physical risks and irreversible impacts like sea-level rise.
Only currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risks.
We selected NGFS orderly and hot house world scenarios for the purpose of our qualitative climate scenario analysis.
The impact of the climate-related risks is analysed on group-wide activities in the short term (before FY2026), medium term (FY2026   FY2035) and long term (After FY2035).
Based on the above-mentioned scenarios, the climate-related risks and opportunities identified by the Group during the ERM exercise includes the following: Climate-related Climate-related Potential Impact Mitigating Measures Risk Opportunity Transition Risk Enhanced With rising concerns over In view of the increase These risks present us GHG emissions the effects of climate GHG emissions reporting with opportunities to reporting change, key stakeholders and increase regulatory deploy our resources obligation and such as the regulators costs, we will continue more efficiently across our increase in and shareholders to use energy resources value chain by installing regulatory costs are demanding responsibly, redefined job machinery of higher more climate-related responsibilities of existing energy efficiency to further information and have employees and send them lower our operating costs.

47 48 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Strategy c. Describe the resilience of the organisation s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 C or lower scenario.
The resilience of an organisation s strategy is dependent on its ability to adapt and thrive in face of changing circumstances and emerging risks.
The climate scenario analysis is crucial in providing insights on the potential extent of the climate-related risk exposure to our businesses as well as the potential opportunities.
Through our climate scenario analysis, we concluded that unmitigated climate risks (under warming scenario Hot house world) may result in a severe financial impact in the long term.
Under the warming scenario orderly, the vast majority of the impact will be attributable to transition risks from the cost increase from enhanced GHG emissions-reporting obligations.
To address the risks and capitalise on opportunities associated with climate change, we will continuously build on our strategy to remain resilient as we progress in our sustainability journey.
Risk Management a. Describe the organisation s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks b. Describe the organisation s processes for managing climate-related risks.
c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisation s overall risk management.
Climate-related risk management is covered under our ERM framework whereby potential climate-related risks are identified, assessed, monitored and managed.
Under the framework, business units and functions are responsible for identifying and documenting their relevant climate-related risk exposures that might hinder their progress towards contributing to the Group s business objectives.
Climate-related risks and opportunities, along with their treatment plans, are reviewed and updated during the ERM assessment exercise and are subsequently presented to the ARMC along with the other key enterprise-wide risks.
Climate-related risks are also monitored based on the trend of climate-related performance indicators.
Metrics and Targets a. Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.
We track, measure and report on our environmental performance, including energy consumption, GHG emissions, water and waste management and disclose related metrics in our sustainability reports.
Monitoring and reporting these metrics help us in identifying areas with key climate-related risks and enabling us to be more targeted in our efforts.
b. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 GHG emissions and the related risks.
To support the climate change agenda, we disclose our Scope 2 GHG emissions in the Report and set climate-related targets such as those related to GHG emissions, water and waste management.
We recognise the importance of monitoring our indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions and started tracking and disclosing indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions from employee commuting (category 7) in FY2024.
We aim to review our Scope 3 GHG emissions to better track and disclose our material Scope 3 GHG emissions and expand the reporting coverage of our Scope 3 GHG emissions on categories relevant to the Group wherever applicable and practicable.
c. Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.
As a commitment towards mitigating climate change, we set climate-related targets related to GHG emissions, water consumption and waste management.
For further details, please refer to the section 11  Targets and Performance Highlights  for climate-related targets set.

Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance The Board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the Company.
The Company endeavours to maintain a strong and independent element on the Board.
The Board is led by Dr. Thng, the Chairman and CEO and in compliance with Provision 2.2 and Provision 2.3 of the Code, independent non-executive directors make up a majority of the Board.
As set out under the Code, an independent director is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director s independent business judgement in the best interests of the Company.
The NC deliberates annually to determine the independence of a director bearing in mind the salient factors set out under the provisions as well as all other relevant circumstances and facts.
To facilitate the NC in its review of the independent status of the directors, each non-executive director will confirm his independence on a yearly basis.
Executive Directors are considered non-independent.
None of the independent directors has any relationships or circumstances which may affect their judgement and ability to discharge their duties and responsibilities as independent directors.
Please also refer to Principle 4 below for details.
All Board appointments are made based on merit, in the context of skills, experience, core competencies, independence and other relevant factors, having due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board and the contribution that the selected candidates bring to the Board.
The Company provides a formal letter to the newly appointed directors upon their appointment setting out their statutory duties and responsibilities as executive or independent directors.
The directors are reminded of their fiduciary duties to act objectively in the best interests of the Company.
They are expected to act in good faith, be honest and diligent in exercising their independent judgement in overseeing the business and affairs of the Company.
In addition, new directors are also provided with background information about the Group s history and core values, its strategic direction and industry specific knowledge.
The Board and Board committees are of an appropriate size and comprise directors who as a group provide the appropriate balance and mix of skills, knowledge, experience, and other aspects of diversity, so as to avoid groupthink and foster constructive debate.
The Board comprises Directors who as a group provide an appropriate balance and diversity of skills and experience including financial, accounting, legal, corporate governance, industry knowledge, strategic planning and customer-based experience, and collectively possesses the necessary core competence to lead the Company effectively.
Please refer to  Board of Directors  on pages 14 and 15 for the details of the Directors  experience.
The Board has adopted a Board Diversity Policy in 2022 which sets out the framework for promoting diversity on the Board.
It recognises and embraces the benefits of diversity on the Board and is committed to building a diverse culture in the Board.
All aspects of diversity are taken into consideration, which includes core competencies as set out above, background, age, gender, ethnicity and other skills and experience.
The NC conducts a review of the Board composition annually to assess if the Board has the appropriate mix of expertise and experience, and meets the Board Diversity Policy.
At the nominating committee meeting held in August 2023, the NC reviewed the Board composition and is of the view that the current Board, as a whole, is of appropriate size and possesses balance and diversity of skillsets, experience and knowledge which are required for the Board to function effectively, although it does not achieve gender diversity.
When reviewing and assessing the composition of the Board, the NC and the Board will consider all aspects of diversity in order to arrive at an optimum balance composition of the Board.
ALLIANCE HEALTHCARE GROUP LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 ALLIANCE HEALTHCARE GROUP LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT The Board recognises the importance and value of gender diversity, and will strive to ensure that when identifying candidates for Board refreshment, female candidates will be included in the search process and duly considered by the NC and the Board for appointment as new Director to the Board.
The selection of candidates is based on a range of diverse factors, including but not limited to age, gender, experience, skills, knowledge and educational background.
The ultimate decision will be based on merit and contribution that the selected candidates will be able to bring to the Board.
The Board s composition (including gender, age, length of service, professional qualifications and working experiences) will be disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report annually.
The NC will review the Board Diversity Policy as and when appropriate to ensure the effectiveness of the policy.
The NC will discuss any revisions that may be required and recommend any such revisions to the Board for consideration and approval.
The independent directors provide, amongst others, strategic guidance to the Company based on their professional knowledge, in particular, assisting to constructively develop proposals on business strategy.
The independent directors also help to review the performance of the management in meeting goals and objectives and monitor their performance.
The independent directors meet without the presence of the management as and when required.
The chairman of such meetings provides feedback to the Board and/or Chairman as appropriate.
During FY2024, the independent directors had met with the external and internal auditors without the presence of the management, in order to provide them with an avenue to candidly express any concerns they may have, including those relating to their ability to perform their work without restraint or interference.
As of the date of this report, there is no independent director who has served for an aggregate period of nine years or more from the date of his first appointment.
Principle 3: Chairman and CEO There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.
The Chairman and the CEO are to be separate persons to ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability, and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision making.
As Dr. Thng is the Executive Chairman and also the CEO of the Company, the Company has not complied with Provision 3.1.
The role of the Chairman and CEO is not separate as the Board is of the view that it is in the best interests of the Company to adopt a single leadership structure.
This ensures that the decision-making process of the Company would not be unnecessarily impeded, and the Company will be able to grasp business opportunities promptly as they arise.
Although the roles are not separated, the Board committees are chaired by independent directors.
In addition, the Board believes that there are sufficient safeguards and checks in place to ensure that the process of decision making by the Board is independent and based on collective decisions, without any individual or group of individuals exercising any considerable concentration of power or influence.

The value in use method required management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from each of the cash-generating units as well as a suitable discount rate in order to measure the recoverable amount.
Any shortfall of the recoverable amount against the carrying amounts would be recognised as impairment losses in profit or loss.
In estimating the future cash flows of the cash-generating units, management forecasted the revenue, growth rates and margins based on presently available information.
These estimates require judgement and the determination of the recoverable amount is a key focus area for our audit.
We discussed with management the process over the determination of the forecasted revenue, growth rates, margins and discount rates.
As the assessment process is judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions, our audit procedures included, among others, using our in-house valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by management.
ALLIANCE HEALTHCARE GROUP LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 ALLIANCE HEALTHCARE GROUP LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ALLIANCE HEALTHCARE GROUP LIMITED Key audit matters (Cont d) We assessed management s estimates applied in the value-in-use models based on our knowledge of the cash-generating units operations, and compared them against historical forecasts and performance and industry statistics.
Our in-house valuation specialists also performed a review of the management s methodology, expectations and the discount rate applied in the impairment assessment and tested the accuracy of the computations.
We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures included in the financial statements.
Other information Management is responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included in the statement by directors and the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the financial reporting standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors  responsibilities include overseeing the group s financial reporting process.
Auditor s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.
We also: a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group s internal control.
83 84 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ALLIANCE HEALTHCARE GROUP LIMITED Auditor s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (Cont d) c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
d) Conclude on the appropriateness of management s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.
e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor s report is Tay Hui Jun, Sabrina.

The assets of the fund may or may not be held separately from those of the entity in an independently administered fund.
The entity contributes an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the salary of each participating employee.
For employee leave entitlement the expected cost of short- term employee benefits in the form of compensated absences is recognised in the case of accumulating compensated absences, when the employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences; and in the case of non-accumulating compensated absences, when the absences occur.
A liability for bonuses is recognised where the entity is contractually obliged or where there is constructive obligation based on past practice.
Share-based compensation Benefits to employees are provided in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares ( equity-settled transactions ).
The fair value of the employee services rendered is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or rights granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
These are fair valued based on the market price of the entity s shares.
This fair value amount is charged to profit or loss over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme, with the corresponding increase in equity.
The value of the charge is adjusted in profit or loss over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual quantities vesting, with the corresponding adjustment made in equity.
Cancellations of grants of equity instruments during the vesting period (other than a grant cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are not satisfied) are accounted for as an acceleration of vesting, therefore any amount unrecognised that would otherwise have been charged is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (Cont d) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowings.
Interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency transactions The functional currency is the Singapore dollar as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
At each end of the reporting year, recorded monetary balances and balances measured at fair value that are denominated in non-functional currencies are reported at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year and fair value measurement dates respectively.
All realised and unrealised exchange adjustment gains and losses are dealt with in profit or loss except when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The presentation is in the functional currency.
Translation of financial statements of other entities Each entity in the group determines the appropriate functional currency as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the relevant reporting entity operates.
In translating the financial statements of such an entity for incorporation in the consolidated financial statements in the presentation currency the assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at end of the reporting year rates of exchange and the income and expense items for each statement presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average rates of exchange for the reporting year.
The resulting translation adjustments (if any) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of that relevant reporting entity.
Income tax Tax expense (tax income) is the aggregate amount included in the determination of profit or loss for the reporting year in respect of current tax and deferred tax.
Current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the reporting year; calculated using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statements of financial position date; and inclusive of any adjustment to income tax payable or recoverable in respect of previous reporting years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method; based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective income tax bases; and determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting year end date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost on initial recognition and after initial recognition at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method to allocate the gross carrying amounts of the assets less their residual values over their estimated useful lives of each part of an item of these assets (or, for certain leased assets, the shorter lease term).
An asset is depreciated when it is available for use until it is derecognised even if during that period the item is idle.
The residual values of assets, useful lives of assets and recognised impairment losses are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, whenever events or circumstances indicate that a revision is warranted.
93 94 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 JUNE 2024 2A.
Material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (Cont d) Property, plant and equipment (Cont d) The useful lives are as follows: Leasehold properties   34 to 59 years Computers and office equipment   2 to 3 years Warehouse equipment   3 to 5 years Furniture and fittings   3 to 5 years Medical equipment   3 to 10 years Motor vehicles   6 years Renovation   3 to 5 years Website and IT software   3 to 10 years The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss.
The residual value and the useful life of an asset is reviewed at least at each end of the reporting year and, if expectations differ significantly from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate, and the depreciation charge for the current and future periods are adjusted.
Cost also includes acquisition cost, borrowing cost capitalised and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset or component to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Subsequent costs are recognised as an asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss when they are incurred.
Right-of-use assets The right-of-use assets are accounted and presented as if they were owned such as property, plant and equipment.
The annual rate of depreciation is as follows: Office space, clinic premises and warehouses   2 to 5 years Leases of lessee A lease conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Where a lease arrangement is identified, a liability to the lessor is recognised as a lease obligation calculated at the present value of minimum unavoidable lease payments.
A corresponding right- of-use asset is recorded.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs and reduction of the lease liability so as to reflect the interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recorded as a finance cost.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less and leases for low value are not recorded as a liability and lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Leases of lessor For a lessor, a lease is classified as either an operating lease or a finance lease.
A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset.
Operating leases are for rental income.
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset and it is presented in its statement of financial position as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
For a finance lease the finance income is recognised over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor s net investment in the lease.

Material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (Cont d) Investment properties Investment properties are properties (land or a building or part of a building or both) owned or held under a finance lease to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes or sale in the ordinary course of business.
It includes an investment property in the course of construction.
After initial recognition at cost including transaction costs the cost model is used to measure the investment property using the treatment for property, plant and equipment, that is, at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
An investment property that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale is carried at the lower of carrying amount and fair value.
For disclosure purposes only, the fair values are measured periodically on a systematic basis by external independent valuers having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued.
The useful lives are as follows: Leasehold properties   Over the remaining leasehold period of between 34 to 44 years from initial recognition Intangible assets An identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance is recognised as an intangible asset at acquisition cost if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
After initial recognition, an intangible asset with finite useful life is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised.
An intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity.
The amortisable amount of an intangible asset with finite useful life is allocated on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life from the point at which the asset is ready for use.
The useful lives are as follows: Customer relationship   5 years Unpatented technology   7 years Development cost incurred relating to the design and testing of new or improved products are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be viable considering its commercial and technical feasibility and its costs can be measured reliably and there are sufficient resources to complete development.
After initial recognition, an intangible asset with finite useful life is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The amortisable amount of an intangible asset with finite useful life is allocated on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life from the point at which the asset is ready for use.
Research expenditure is expensed when incurred.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development cost is expensed when incurred.
Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognised separately from goodwill if the asset s fair value can be measured reliably, irrespective of whether the asset had been recognised by the acquiree before the business combination.
An intangible asset is considered identifiable only if it is separable or if it arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations.
95 96 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 JUNE 2024 2A.
Material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (Cont d) Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity including unincorporated and special purpose entity that is controlled by the reporting entity and the reporting entity is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that the reporting entity has the practical ability to exercise (that is, substantive rights) are considered when assessing whether the reporting entity controls another entity.
In the reporting entity s separate financial statements, an investment in a subsidiary is accounted for at cost less any allowance for impairment in value.
Impairment loss recognised in profit or loss for a subsidiary is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in a subsidiary are not necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realised in a current market exchange.
Associates An associate is an entity including an unincorporated entity in which the reporting entity has a significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the reporting entity.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
An investment in an associate includes goodwill on acquisition, which is accounted for in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations.
However the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested under the financial reporting standard on impairment, by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value) with its carrying amount, whenever application of the requirements in the financial reporting standard on financial instruments indicates that the investment may be impaired.
In the consolidated financial statements, the accounting for investments in an associate is on the equity method.
Under the equity method the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor s share of the investee s net assets.
The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in the associate are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realised in a current market exchange.
The investor s profit or loss includes its share of the investee s profit or loss and the investor s other comprehensive income includes its share of the investee s other comprehensive income.
Losses of an associate in excess of the reporting entity s interest in the relevant associate are not recognised except to the extent that the reporting entity has an obligation.
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the reporting entity and an associate are recognised in the financial statements only to the extent of unrelated reporting entity s interests in the associate.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the reporting entity.
The reporting entity discontinues the use of the equity method from the date that when its investment ceases to be an associate and accounts for the investment in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments from that date.
Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Any investment retained in the former associate is measured at fair value at the date that it ceases to be an associate.
Accounting policies of associates are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the reporting entity.
Non-controlling interests The non-controlling interest is equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the reporting entity as the parent.
The non-controlling interest is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the equity of the owners of the parent.
For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (subsidiary) is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest s proportionate share of the acquiree s identifiable net assets.
Where the non-controlling interest is measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and key model inputs used are disclosed in the relevant note.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
ALLIANCE HEALTHCARE GROUP LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 ALLIANCE HEALTHCARE GROUP LIMITED | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 JUNE 2024 2A.
Material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (Cont d) Goodwill Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised.
Goodwill is recognised as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (a) over (b); (a) being the aggregate of: (i) the consideration transferred which generally requires acquisition-date fair value; (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations (measured either at fair value or as the non-controlling interest s proportionate share of the acquiree s net identifiable assets); and (iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer s previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and (b) being the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations.
After initial recognition, goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised.
Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, goodwill and also any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or any intangible asset not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually.
Goodwill impairment is not reversed in any circumstances.
For the purpose of impairment testing and since the acquisition date of the business combination, goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit, or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree were assigned to those units or groups of units.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than a segment.
Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost (weighted average method) and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
A write down on cost is made where the cost is not recoverable or if the selling prices have declined.
Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Carrying amounts of non-financial assets The carrying amount of non-financial assets is reviewed at each end of the reporting year for indications of impairment and where an asset is impaired, it is written down through profit or loss to its estimated recoverable amount.
The impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount and is expensed.
Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an annual impairment test is performed at about the same time every year on an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use.
When the fair value less costs of disposal method is used, any available recent market transactions are taken into consideration.
When the value in use method is adopted, in assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
At each end of the reporting year non-financial assets other than goodwill with impairment loss recognised in prior periods are assessed for possible reversal of the impairment.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been measured, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
97 98 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 JUNE 2024 2A.
Material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (Cont d) Financial instruments Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments: A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised when, and only when, the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) are recognised and derecognised, as applicable, using trade date accounting or settlement date accounting.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.
A financial liability is removed from the statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished, that is, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
At initial recognition the financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.
Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities: The financial reporting standard on financial instruments requires the categorisation of financial instruments.
At the end of the reporting year, the reporting entity had the following categories financial assets and financial liabilities:   Financial asset classified as measured at amortised cost: A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), that is (a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and (b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Typically trade and other receivables, bank and cash balances are classified in this category.
Financial asset classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.
In addition, on initial recognition, management may irrevocably designate a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.
Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) in either of the following circumstances: (1) the liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or (2) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
All other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Reclassification of any financial liability is not permitted.
Cash and cash equivalents For the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash and cash equivalents less cash subject to restriction and bank overdrafts payable on demand that form an integral part of cash management.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For cash subjected to restriction, assessment is made on the economic substance of the restriction and whether they meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents.

Material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (Cont d) Derivative financial instruments A derivative financial instrument is a financial instrument with all three of the following characteristics (a) its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices, credit ratings or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract; (b) it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors; and (c) it is settled at a future date.
The derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently classified as measured at FVTPL unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
Fair value measurement The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, market observable data to the extent possible is used.
If the fair value of an asset or a liability is not directly observable, an estimate is made using valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs (e.g. by use of the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar items, discounted cash flow analysis, or option pricing models refined to reflect the issuer s specific circumstances).
Inputs used are consistent with the characteristics of the asset/liability that market participants would take into account.
The entity s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil a liability is not taken into account as relevant when measuring fair value.
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the measurement are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised at the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred.
The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.
The fair values of non-current financial instruments may not be disclosed separately unless there are significant differences at the end of the reporting year and in the event the fair values are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
Segment reporting The reporting entity discloses financial and descriptive information about its consolidated reportable segments.
Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria.
Operating segments are components about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance.
Generally, financial information is reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.
Provisions A liability or provision is recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
A provision is made using best estimates of the amount required in settlement and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount recognised is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
99 100 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30 JUNE 2024 2A.
Material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (Cont d) Put option financial liability Where the group writes put options with non-controlling shareholders of subsidiaries, entitling the non-controlling shareholders concerned to sell their equity interests in the subsidiaries back to the group for settlement in cash or another financial asset within a stipulated period upon the occurrence of specified conditions or events, the group recognises a liability based on the present value of the redemption amount of the put options.
Subsequent to initial recognition of the financial liability, the group has adopted an accounting policy to recognise the changes in the present value of the put option financial liabilities in equity.
If the put option expires unexercised, then the put option financial liability is derecognised, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Treasury shares Where the entity reacquires its own equity instruments as treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental cost is deducted from equity attributable to the entity s owners until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the entity s owners and no gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
2B.
Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties Disclosures on material information about the assumptions management made about the future, and other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below or in the in the corresponding Notes to these financial statements.
These estimates and assumptions are periodically monitored to ensure they incorporate all relevant information available at the date when financial statements are prepared.
However, this does not prevent actual figures differing from estimates.
Assessing impairment of goodwill: The amount of goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
This annual impairment test is material and the process is complex and highly judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.
As a result, judgement is required in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by management, in particular those relating to the forecasted revenue growth and profit margins.
The disclosures about goodwill are included in Note 18, which explains that small changes in the key assumptions used could give rise to an impairment of the goodwill balance in the future.
Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates.
Assessing expected credit loss allowance on trade receivables: The assessment of the expected credit losses (ECL) requires a degree of estimation and judgement.
In measuring the expected credit losses.
Management considers all reasonable and supportable information such as the reporting entity s past experience at collecting receipts, any increase in the number of delayed receipts in the portfolio past the average credit period, and forward looking information such as forecasts of future economic conditions.
The carrying amounts might change materially within the next reporting year but these changes may not arise from assumptions or other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year.
The carrying amount is disclosed in the Note 21 on trade and other receivables.
Estimating income tax amounts: The entity recognises tax liabilities and assets tax based on an estimation of the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items.
Where the actual amount arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax amounts in the period when such determination is made.
In addition, management judgement is required in determining the amount of current and deferred tax recognised and the extent to which amounts should or can be recognised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses if it is probable that the entity will earn sufficient taxable profit in future periods to benefit from a reduction in tax payments.
This involves the management making assumptions within its overall tax planning activities and periodically reassessing them in order to reflect changed circumstances as well as tax regulations.
As a result, due to their inherent nature assessments of likelihood are judgemental and not susceptible to precise determination.
The income tax amounts are disclosed in the Note 10 on income tax.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENTS (CONT D) 4A.
Information about reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities (Cont d) Such a structural organisation is determined by the nature of risks and returns associated with each business segment and it defines the management structure as well as the internal reporting system.
It represents the basis on which the management reports the primary segment information that is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance.
They are managed separately because each business requires different strategies.
The segments and the types of products and services are as follows: The GP clinic services segment is in the business of provision of primary healthcare medical services by general practitioners.
The specialist care services segment is in the business of provision of medical services by specialists.
The managed healthcare solutions segment is in the business of providing managed healthcare solutions to corporations and insurance companies by establishing an extensive network of medical service providers to deliver healthcare services to the employees of corporations, or as the case may be insured members of policyholders of insurance companies or by providing direct medical services to the employees of corporations concerned.
The pharmaceutical services segment is in the business of wholesale of pharmaceutical products services (including medicines and health supplements) as well as medical devices.
The mobile and digital health services segment is in the business of making medical care within reach through mobile and home care services.
The others segment is in the business of investment holding and provision of administrative and management services.
Inter-segment sales are measured on the basis that the entity actually used to price the transfers.
Internal transfer pricing policies of the reporting entity are as far as practicable based on market prices.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the significant accounting policies.
The management reporting system evaluates performances based on a number of factors.
However the primary financial performance measurement to evaluate segment s operating results comprises one major financial indicator: earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortisation ( EBITDA ).
The following tables illustrate the information about the reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities.

It was based on the direct comparison method to reflect the actual market state and circumstances as of the end of the reporting year.
Management determined that the direct comparison of the asset is the current use and that it would provide maximum value to market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets.
For the year ended 30 June 2023, management has assessed the fair value based on the valuation of a recently purchased unit in the same building.
This valuation was made by GB Global Pte Ltd, a firm of independent professional valuers in March 2023.
For fair value measurements categorised within the fair value hierarchy below, a description of the valuation techniques and the significant other observable inputs used in the fair value measurement are as follows: Asset: Leasehold properties at 25 Bukit Batok Crescent, Singapore 658066 Tenure: 60 years from 13 March 1997 (expiring 12 March 2057) Fair Value and Fair value hierarchy   Level: $7,002,000 (2023: $7,129,000) Level 3 (2023: Level 3) Valuation technique for recurring fair value Direct comparison method measurements: Significant observable inputs: Price per square foot: $561 (2023: $571) Sensitivity on management s estimates   10% Impact   lower/higher by $700,000 (2023: lower/higher by variation from estimate: $713,000) The investment properties are mortgaged or pledged as security for bank facilities (see Note 27).
The leasehold properties are classified as investment properties in the company s balance sheet as they are majority leased out to certain subsidiaries of the group.

The contract assets are transferred to the receivables when the rights become unconditional.
The expected credit losses (ECL) on the trade receivables, and contract assets are based on the simplified approach to measuring ECL which uses a lifetime ECL allowance approach for all such assets recognised from initial recognition of these assets.
These assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due for measuring the ECL.
The allowance model is based on the historical observed default rates (over a period of 36 months) over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates including the impact of the current economic conditions.
At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
The ageing of the assets is as follows: Gross amount Loss allowance 2024 2023 2024 2023 $ $ $ $ Group Trade receivables and contract assets: Current 14,084,879 13,511,684     1 to 60 days past due 14,719,310 6,623,712     61 to 90 days past due 883,290 253,756     Over 90 days past due 3,088,875 1,268,965 503 4,947 Total 32,776,354 21,658,117 503 4,947 Company Trade receivables and contract assets Current 3,164,708 1,995,570     1 to 60 days past due 5,000,078 1,492,987     61 to 90 days past due 312,500 169,561     Over 90 days past due 2,685,063 3,860,519     Total 11,162,349 7,518,637     The amounts are written off when there are indications that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery or the failure of a debtor to make contractual payments over an extended period.
There is no collateral held as security and other credit enhancements for the trade receivables.
As part of the process of setting customer credit limits, different credit terms are used.
The average credit period generally granted to trade customers is about 30 days (2023: 30 days).
But some customers take a longer period to settle the amounts.
The balances include amounts due from credit card companies and NETS.
For these, the average credit period generally granted is a few days.

The other receivables can be graded for credit risk individually.
At inception they are recorded net of expected 12-month credit losses.
At each reporting date, an evaluation is made whether there is a significant change in credit risk by comparing the debtor s credit risk at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified cash flows) with the credit risk at the reporting date (based on the modified cash flows).
Adjustment to the loss allowance is made for any increase or decrease in credit risk.
At the end of the reporting year, a loss allowance is recognised at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition including the impact of the current economic condition.
No loss allowance was necessary.
Other receivables are normally with no fixed terms and therefore there is no maturity.

SHARE CAPITAL (CONT D) The ordinary shares of no par value are fully paid, carry one vote each and have no right to fixed income.
The company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
During the financial year, the company acquired Nil (2023: 1,000,000) of its ordinary shares by way of on-market purchase for a total consideration of $Nil (2023: $173,960).
Capital management: The objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the Group s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for owners and benefits for other stakeholders, and to provide an adequate return to owners by pricing the sales commensurately with the level of risk.
The management sets the amount of capital to meet its requirements and the risk taken.
There were no changes in the approach to capital management during the reporting year.
The management manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it where necessary or possible in the light of changes in conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the management may adjust the amount of dividends paid to owners, return capital to owners, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The management monitors the capital on the basis of the debt-to-adjusted capital ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt/adjusted capital (as shown below).
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Adjusted capital comprises all components of equity (that is, share capital and reserves).

Not meaningful There are material borrowings but these are secured by specific assets.
The debt-to-adjusted capital ratio may not provide a meaningful indicator of the risk from borrowings.
In order to maintain its listing on the SGX-ST, the company has to have share capital with a free float of at least 10% of the shares.
The company met the capital requirement on its initial listing and the rules limiting treasury share purchases mean it will continue to satisfy that requirement, as it did throughout the reporting year.
Management receives a report from the share registrars frequently on substantial share interests showing the non-free float to ensure continuing compliance with the 10% limit throughout the reporting year.
The management does not set a target level of gearing but uses capital opportunistically to support its business and to add value for shareholders.
The key discipline adopted is to widen the margin between the return on capital employed and the cost of that capital.

The lease contracts are usually for fixed periods of 3 to 5 years but may have extension options.
Lease terms contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.
The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.
The lease liabilities above do not include the short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low- value underlying assets.
Variable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate or based on a percentage of revenue are not included from the initial measurement of the lease liability and the right- to-use assets.
Only variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate; payments that vary to reflect changes in market rental rates are included in the measurement of the lease liability.
Such variable amounts that are unpaid at the commencement date are included in the measurement of lease liability.
Variable lease payments would also include extension options and termination options; residual value guarantees; and leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed.
The variable lease payments that based on revenue are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.
Lease liabilities under operating leases are secured by the right-of-use assets because these will revert to the lessor in the event of default.
Other information about the leasing activities relating to the right-of-use assets are summarised as follows: Office space, clinic premises and warehouses 2024 2023 Group: Number of right-of-use assets 27 24 Remaining term   range 1 to 4.75 years 1 to 4.75 years Remaining term   average 2.08 years 1.75 years Number of leases with extension options 27 24 Weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities 2.9% to 4.7% 4.5% to 4.7% Number of leases with variable payments linked to an index 27 24 Number of leases with termination options 27 24 A summary of the maturity analysis of lease liabilities is disclosed in Note 33E.

Financial risk management The main purpose for holding or issuing financial instruments is to raise and manage the finances for the entity s operating, investing and financing activities.
There are exposures to the financial risks on the financial instruments such as credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk comprising interest rate, currency risk and price risk exposures.
Management has certain practices for the management of financial risks.
However these are not documented in formal written documents.
The following guidelines are followed: All financial risk management activities are carried out and monitored by senior management staff.
All financial risk management activities are carried out following acceptable market practices.
There have been no changes to the exposures to risk; the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk.
33C.
Fair values of financial instruments The analyses of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
These include the significant financial instruments stated at amortised cost and at fair value in the statement of financial position.
The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short- term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.
33D.
Credit risk on financial assets Financial assets subject to concentrations of credit risk and failures by counterparties to discharge their obligations in full or in a timely manner arise principally from cash balances with banks, receivables and other financial assets.
The general approach in the financial reporting standard on financial instruments is applied to measure expected credit losses (ECL) allowance on financial assets the ECL allowance.
On initial recognition, a day-1 loss is recorded equal to the 12-month ECL unless the assets are considered credit impaired.
The ECL allowance for debt assets is recognised at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition.
However, for trade receivables that do not contain a material financing component or when the reporting entity applies the practical expedient of not adjusting the effect of a material financing component, the simplified approach in calculating ECL is applied.
Under the simplified approach, the loss allowance is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime ECL at each reporting date using historical loss rates for the respective risk categories and incorporating forward-looking estimates.
Lifetime ECL may be estimated individually or collectively.
For the credit risk on the financial assets an ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the debtors and any loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Reviews and assessments of credit exposures in excess of designated limits are made.
Renewals and reviews of credits limits are subject to the same review process.
Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of the standard on financial instruments.
There was no identified impairment loss.

The following table analyses the breakdown of the significant financial instruments by type of interest rate: Group Company 2024 2023 2024 2023 $ $ $ $ Financial liabilities: Floating rates 10,310,619 7,112,397 5,453,664 4,837,473 Fixed rates 9,740,509 6,081,286 693,357 842,801 At end of the year 20,051,128 13,193,683 6,147,021 5,680,274 The analysis has been performed for floating interest rate over a year for financial instruments.
The impact of a change in interest rates on floating interest rate financial instruments has been assessed in terms of changing of their cash flows and therefore in terms of the impact on profit or loss.
The hypothetical changes in basis points are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Sensitivity analysis: The effect on pre-tax profit is not material.
33G.
Foreign currency risk There is no significant exposure to foreign currency risk as part of its normal business.
