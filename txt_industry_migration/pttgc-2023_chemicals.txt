Geoeconomic The plastic industry faces pressure from numerous factors, such as the Confrontations crisis of constantly rising energy and commodity prices, financial aid and measures from the government that lack stability, political tensions in various regions, and the use of economic barriers as tools to create political advantage.
These factors have become a hardship of economic cooperations and result in shorter supply chains.
Causes & Consequences Ineffectiveness of multilateral Interstate conflict institutions and international cooperation Use of weapons of mass destruction State collapse or severe instability Geoeconomic Collapse of a systemically important Interstate conflict Confrontations industry or supply chain Collapse of a systemically important Ineffectiveness of multilateral industry or supply chain institutions and international cooperation Natural resource crises Cost of living crisis Additional information the economic outlook related to global geoeconomic conflicts is available at: Category of Risk Geopolitical Source of Risk Geopolitical factor and macroeconomics factor Business Impact   The fluctuation of plastic pellet prices in accordance with global crude oil prices due to geopolitical risks may occasionally affect production costs.
Lower purchasing power due to increased inflation has prompted the population and consumers to exercise more caution in their spending.
Meanwhile, manufacturers can hardly pass higher production costs through to downstream industries.
Impact on GC s supply chain in the areas of procurement, machinery, equipment, and essential chemicals leads to limitations and higher costs as well as volatile economic direction.
Economic protection measures in many countries may cause GC to lose markets and competitiveness.
The trend of government policy changes and the lack of economic flexibility lead to a delay in investment, generating potential impact on GC s growth and investment plans.

The limitation of crude oil or other fossil fuel supply also affects the continuity of GC s production processes.
Ineffective greenhouse gas management affects image and reliability as well as investors  interest.
GC s operating costs increase as a result of stricter environmental policies, carbon credit costs, and efforts to develop pollution reduction technology to cope with climate change and more stringent regulations.
Increased environmental awareness among consumers leads to higher demand for eco-friendly and low-carbon products.
Consequently, GC needs to develop products that are consistent with changing consumer needs.
The global effort to reduce fossil fuel consumption may decrease the value of GC s assets which are linked to traditional petrochemical processes.

Highlight process innovations in 2023   2566     include OLE Online Heater Cleaning, Phenol Heavy   Residue Upgrading to Carbon Black Feedstock,   (Online Heater Cleaning for Olefins Plant) Visbreaker Unit Optimization Model, and B-LEAP.
(Phenol Heavy Residue)           (Visbreaker Unit Optimization Model)   Online Heater Cleaning for Olefins Plant   B-LEAP         The combustion of fuel gases inside the furnace causes             soot to accumulate into an insulating layer, decreasing     heat transfer efficiency and increasing fuel consumption.
Thus, cleaning is crucial.
However, the current foam     cleaning process can only be performed when the                   heater is inactive.
Therefore, GC has developed an                   online cleaning method by injecting cleaning chemicals     and using an online data system to regulate and achieve     the desired level of cleaning efficiency.
In terms of other       advantages, this innovation does not generate wastewater       from the process of cleaning while reducing work-related                 risks to employee safety as work in confined spaces is not required.
The implementation of this project will     further enhance heater cleaning efficiency and is   expected to reduce 8 percent of energy consumption             8       resulting in EBITDA uplift 4-million-baht per year.
