155 Sustainability Report 2022 3 Sustainability Report 2022 1 Letter from the Chairman Marc Murtra Chairman Once again, I have the pleasure of addressing you as we publish our Sustainability Report and Non- Financial Information Statement for the 2022 financial year.
It has been a year marked by a challenging global environment of instability, despite which we have made important progress on economic, social, environmental and corporate governance fronts.
The Board of Directors sees Indra's performance in 2022 as very positive and we have full confidence in the company's ability to navigate a context full of challenges, but also considerable opportunities.
We recently marked the one year anniversary of the outbreak of war in Ukraine, which has seen the return, in all its horror, of conventional warfare to Europe.
There is still a great deal of lingering uncertainty over the outcome, duration and global repercussions of the war, but the humanitarian tragedy has been very much a part of it from the beginning.
The conflict has also brought with it other undesired consequences, such as a worsening of the energy crisis in Europe, added strains on global supply chains, and spiralling inflation accompanied by sharp interest rate increases.
Indra was ranked the world s number one company in the IT Services sector by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for a second year running and recognised by S&P as  Gold Class  in its Sustainability Yearbook for a third consecutive year It is within this context that challenges such as the demand for security, and the transition to renewable energy sources and sustainable transport, occupy an ever-greater place in our collective consciousness and have regained a renewed sense of urgency.
Such challenges are inextricably linked to sustainability, and technology, as a fundamental component of our response to them, has a key role to play here.
At Indra, our goal is to use technology to drive sustainability and by doing so create value for all our stakeholders.
We are well aware of just how important sustainability will be for the company over the coming years.
This drive for sustainability is not only reflected in the way our products and services assist the communities in which we operate, it can also be seen in the way we go about our work.
Thanks to our efforts in this area, in 2022 Indra was ranked the world s number one company for sustainability in the IT Services sector by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for a second year running and was recognised by S&P as  Gold Class  in its Sustainability Yearbook for a third consecutive year.
These acknowledgements come in addition to its recognition as an  A-list  company for its action against Climate Change in the CDP index and its inclusion once again in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index.
Lastly, I would like to extend my sincere thanks both to all of our employees for their outstanding work and to all of our shareholders for their continuing support.
Thank you on behalf of the entire Indra Board of Directors.
Marc Murtra Chairman of Indra Sustainability Report 2022 4 Sustainability Report 2022 2 Message from the CEO Ignacio Mataix CEO The efforts of our excellent team of professionals, along with the confidence our clients place in us, allowed the company to end 2022 on a historic high, having achieved record figures for order intake and backlog, as well as for revenue and EBIT.
The main items on our income statement experienced double-digit growth, ultimately resulting in a 20% increase in our earnings per share.
Our cash generation for the year was also excellent   the second best in the company s history   which allowed us to reduce net debt to practically zero.
Thanks to these results, we are in a position to significantly increase shareholder remuneration through the proposed dividend increase announced.
Indra s commercial performance in 2022 has been outstanding, with double-digit growth in our order intake, which has meant revenue has also increased at double-digit rates.
Our order backlog is also at a new all- time high and, more importantly, includes contracts such as the FCAS that will transform the company and also substantially improve our long-term vision.
All this growth has resulted in increased profitability for our two divisions, thanks to the operating leverage provided by our sales growth, improvements to our product mix and the implementation of our efficiency plans   and this despite the high wage inflation prevalent in our markets.
Indra achieved record figures in 2022 for order intake and backlog, as well as revenue and EBIT Once again this year, it is important to mention Indra's impressive ESG performance.
This year Indra realised the achievement of being rated the most sustainable company in its sector for the second consecutive year, ranking among the top 1% of the most sustainable companies in the world according to S&P Global s Sustainability Yearbook for 2023.
It also featured on the CDP s prestigious Climate Change A List for 2022 in recognition of the company s best practices on environmental leadership.
These excellent results, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, the quality and size of our order backlog, and our fantastic team of professionals, have set us in unbeatable stead to handle our growth and the strategic decisions that will need to be made in the years to come.
Our strategy is based on helping our clients successfully overcome their sustainability challenges We are deeply committed to sustainability and the social impact of our business operations: we have cut CO emissions by 26%, narrowed the wage gap, increased the percentage of women hired with STEM 2 profiles and the percentage of young women hired aged 30 and below, and senior management incentives are tied to our ESG objectives.
We are a knowledge-intensive company, and as such developing and attracting the best talent is a strategic goal of our business.
This year we have successfully offered an attractive project for the future to a large number of professionals, employing more than 19,000 new recruits.
By enhancing our training plans   which have reached over a million hours of training   and actively championing professional development, Sustainability Report 2022 5 Sustainability Report 2022 we have clearly demonstrated our steadfast commitment to driving internal growth and attracting the best technological talent.
We would like to extend our sincere thanks to the remarkable team of professionals that work tirelessly to help make our aspirations a reality and achieve the goals we set ourselves.
We would also like to thank our clients for continuing to place their trust in us and our partners and suppliers for their ongoing support and invaluable collaboration.
Ignacio Mataix CEO Sustainability Report 2022 6 Sustainability Report 2022 Indra is for the 2nd consecutive year the world's leading technology company in sustainability In 2022, Indra was ranked for the second consecutive year as the No.

In addition to the grave humanitarian crisis it has provoked, the global repercussions of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have also impacted a number of other areas, resulting in:   A deepening energy crisis.
Greater strains on global supply chains.
A sharp rise in inflation and increases in interest rates.
Regarding geopolitics, the impact of the invasion has extended far beyond the regions directly affected by the conflict: Notably, the economic and technological rivalry between the USA and China has resulted in rising tensions between the two.
We can therefore expect to see a period of geopolitical change, the impact of which over the medium to long term is hard to fully predict.
As far as health is concerned, the worst of the Covid pandemic is now behind us and most of the world has seen a gradual return to normality.
In a climate of uncertainty, technology is the key to remaining competitive over the long term In the following paragraphs, we look at the main trends having an impact on Indra s business within a context of more rapid digital transformation and in which Defence and Security are becoming ever more important.
Digital capabilities crucial to ensuring superior products and services Digitalisation is reducing the time needed to develop new products and bring them to market, speeding up R&D cycles.
Digitally native business niches are emerging (e.g. in unmanned traffic management, new payment systems, aftermarket services, etc.
), as well as new,  as-a-service  business models (mobility, predictive maintenance, core banking, and infrastructure as a service).
Within Defence programmes, Defence Electronics and systems are playing an ever more prominent role.
Importance of scale and increased rates of consolidation In the markets where Indra operates, achieving scale is an increasingly important part of remaining competitive, providing the investment in R&D needed to keep pace with rapid innovation cycles.
There is a tendency towards consolidation amongst industry giants and digital global players.
Mergers and acquisitions are increasingly aimed at complementing one s portfolio and acquiring end-to-end capabilities.
Within the Defence sector, achieving scale is also essential to becoming a prime contractor and gaining access to major programmes.
Value creation concentrated in the West North America and Western Europe continues to be home to the majority of tech businesses leading the way in value creation and innovation.
Asia s technology and industry hubs are nonetheless gaining in importance globally.
Blurring the boundaries between industries, clients and competitors With the adoption of digital technology, the boundaries between traditional value chains are becoming blurred, as are the roles of customer, competitor and supplier, with value migrating to new digital ecosystems.
Heightened concern over sustainability and Climate Change Sustainability has become a major concern of societies across the globe, and this has resulted in growing demands from governments, investors, clients and employees: Sustainability Report 2022 9 Sustainability Report 2022   Greater regulatory requirements are being imposed on good governance, Human Rights, the fight against Climate Change and transparency in reporting.
Investors, analysts and ratings agencies are including ESG considerations in their valuations, with a good ESG performance opening up access to finance under better terms.
In order to encourage sustainability throughout the value chain, businesses are increasing the demands they make of, and control they have over, suppliers.
Business opportunities associated with the macrotrend towards sustainability have notably emerged in such areas as energy transition and sustainable mobility.
Strategic autonomy as a top priority for the EU Both the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine have exposed the EU s heavy dependence on third countries when it comes to certain strategic sectors.
As a result, the EU has adopted a three-pronged approach to increasing its strategic autonomy, aimed at:   Developing its Defence capabilities, through increased investment and greater cooperation between countries.
Reducing its energy dependence.
Strengthening its economic base and cultivating industries and technology with high potential for the future, such as Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Industry 4.0, Space and Quantum Technology.
Defence now a prime concern in Europe The insecurity caused by the invasion of Ukraine has changed our perception of the risks and threats to the way of life in European countries.
As a society, we have become more aware of the need to increase defence capabilities in order to confront potential threats.
The invasion of Ukraine has seen NATO reassume its central role in European Defence, with almost all countries announcing that they will fulfil their commitment to spend 2% of GDP on Defence in the short to medium term.
In order to draw the most benefit from this outlay, we can expect to see greater cooperation between European countries in this area.
Given these circumstances, one of the sectors offering the most in terms of potential opportunities is the Defence industry, which supplies the Armed Forces with the systems needed to carry out their work.

The company establishes long-term relationships with its clients, becoming their tech partner for their key business operations.
To achieve this, Indra s team of professionals combines solid technological capabilities with an in-depth knowledge of both markets and the needs of their clients.
However, sustainability also forms a fundamental part of its corporate purpose, with Indra actively driving the sustainability of its clients through technology.
Indra is one of the leading international technology and consultancy companies, accruing global sales of  3,851 million in 2022 Indra s structure is divided into two business divisions that both share a solid technological base   Transport and Defence and Information Technology, the latter operating under the Minsait brand.
Although technology lies at the heart of the company s business model in both divisions, they both present very different business dynamics.
Transport and Defence (T&D) As a leading provider of in-house solutions for specific segments of the Transport and Defence markets, Indra is an international leader in high value-add niche technological markets.
Its products mainly target governments and public administrations, with an emphasis on products in which hardware and electronics are a key element.
However, software and digital technologies are having an increasingly greater influence on these markets.
The T&D division spans three markets, and has a considerable international presence across all three: Defence and Security, Air Traffic and Transport:   Defence and Security.
A benchmark in Europe in the field of defence systems, Indra is one of the three European companies most involved in the new European Defence Fund (EDF).
The company boasts tried and tested experience on the world stage, offering proprietary solutions in the segments of air defence, on-board systems on airborne, naval and land-based platforms, border security and surveillance, electronic defence, simulation, space and communications satellites.
Indra is key to Europe s main current and future airborne programmes, such as Eurofighter and FCAS (Future Combat Air System).
It plays a particularly important role in the latter as Spain s national industrial coordinator and is the global leader in sensor technology.
Air Traffic.
Indra is one of the leading suppliers of air traffic management systems and equipment worldwide, with installations in more than 170 countries.
Indra s technology is present in ~200 control centres, ~1,700 ILS systems (Instrument Landing System) and ~400 secondary radars across the globe, and the company is a key industrial partner in the Single European Sky initiative.
Indra is also leading the transformation of the sector with the development of innovation-based initiatives across multiple arenas such as U-Space (air traffic management of unmanned systems), virtual control towers, and communications satellite services, navigation and surveillance.
During the last year, Indra has signed a binding agreement to acquire the air traffic management business of Selex ES Inc., with the aim of breaking into the US market and consolidating its global leadership.
2022 also saw Indra win a contract to renew the entire air surveillance radar network in Germany.
Transport.
Indra has an integrated technology suite that includes ticketing and toll systems, information and control systems for multiple infrastructures and modes of transport, rail safety and signalling systems, as well as transport consulting and planning capabilities.
Indra is a tech partner on multiple infrastructure projects across Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Oceania, looking to offer society safer, more sustainable and more efficient means of transport.
The company also heads up some of Europe s leading innovation-based initiatives in the digitalisation of transport and intelligent solutions, such as the Shift2Rail, Mobility 2030 and Comp4Drones projects.
Sustainability Report 2022 12 Sustainability Report 2022 Information Technology (Minsait) Indra groups all its Information Technology (IT) businesses under the Minsait brand.

Particularly worthy of mention is the investment made in recent years in four of the fastest-growing business areas which are expected to see more than double-digit growth (Means of Payment, Phygital, Cloud-Data and Cybersecurity).
Minsait has industry-specific end-to-end value proposals, designed to generate value in response to the challenges faced by clients in each sector and guarantee the cybersecurity of their operations:   Energy and Industry.

Thanks to its far-reaching international presence, 50% of its annual sales come from outside of Spain.
The company s main head offices are located in Spain, where Indra is the leading technology company in the industrial sector.
However, the company also has a major presence in Latin America and Europe.

The Plan s aim is to define the company s main strategic lines of action, tailor them to the current trends shaping the market and achieve sustainable, profitable growth in the mid to long term.
In 2021 and 2022, the company successfully met the financial targets set out in its Strategic Plan, with 2023 expected to be no different in this regard.
The strong order intake of recent years has taken the portfolio to record levels and led to sustained growth in sales.
What s more, the increased profitability of the business has allowed Indra to pay its shareholders dividends after being unable to do so for several years.
2023 is the final year in the company s 2021-2023 strategic cycle.
As such, this year will see work begin on setting out a new Plan that will steer the company s growth over the coming years and take account of new and emerging market trends.
Sustainability is included as a key issue in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan, in line with the main market trends that could potentially have a significant impact on the company s operations.
Specific initiatives in this area have been developed as part of the 2020-2023 Sustainability Master Plan.
Over the course of this report, more detailed information will be given regarding the progress made towards achieving the goals set out in the Sustainability Master Plan.
For more information on Indra s business model, the markets in which it operates and its strategy, we recommend reading the investor presentation available and regularly updated on the Indra website.

Fairness: to encourage dialogue with shareholders, investors and other stakeholders and equal treatment of all parties.
Respect for shareholders  rights: to implement measures to promote informed shareholder participation and the exercise of their rights.
Responsible compliance by management: active supervision with specific and non-delegable responsibilities.
Transparency: both in informative terms and regarding the commitment to dialogue with all stakeholders.
Corporate regulations and policies Indra s management model comprises a set of standards and policies that not only seek to comply with the legislation in force, but to also incorporate the best practices and recommendations in terms of Corporate Governance.
The internal regulations and the main corporate policies are available on the company website.
The Sustainability Policy reflects the company s commitments to all its stakeholders and represents a reference framework to guarantee responsible behaviour.
The current Sustainability Policy has been approved by the Board, is public and can be viewed on the company website.
Indra reviews its internal regulations in order to adopt the best practices and recommendations in terms of Corporate Governance, as well as the main international benchmark standards Indra complies very closely with the recommendations of the Code of Good Governance of Listed Companies, as set out in section G of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
The company is continuously working to align its corporate governance strategy with international benchmark standards.
In 2022, the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee (ARCGC) and the Board of Directors appraised the efficacy of and compliance with the Corporate Governance rules, assessing the need to approve any amendments or proposed amendments to these rules, as detailed below:   In May 2022, following a proposal from the ARCGC, the Board of Directors agreed to amend Article 8.4 of the Board of Directors Regulations and Articles 3 and 5 of the Director Selection Policy in order to extend the definition of diversity to include  cultural  diversity.
In addition, it was agreed on the same date to amend Article 33.1 of the Board of Directors Regulations in order to establish a requirement for minimum attendance by directors at meetings of the Board and its Committees.
In September 2022, following a proposal by the ARCGC, the Board of Directors agreed to propose to the Extraordinary General Shareholders  Meeting that it amend Article 24 of the Articles of Association and remove the casting vote held by the Board s Chair.
This amendment was also introduced into the Board Regulations in October 2022.
Remuneration of Executive Directors and the Chair of the Board Executive directors receive the remuneration due to them for the performance of the executive duties entrusted to them under the terms of their contractual relationship with the company.
This remuneration is determined individually for each of them by the Board of Directors, following a proposal from the ARCGC.
It is the Company s established practice to set the payment framework for executive directors for three-year periods.
The current Remuneration Policy was approved by the General Shareholders  Meeting on 30 June 2021 for the period from 2021 to 2023.
It is public and can be found on the company website.
Sustainability Report 2022 18 Sustainability Report 2022 With regard to fixed remuneration, this Policy establishes that, in certain situations and following a proposal from the ARCGC, the Board may approve an increase in this remuneration.
The changes to the governance structure that were made during the financial year (a CEO and an Executive Director and IT Managing Director) have led to adjustments to the fixed remuneration amounts provided for in the Policy.
These amendments, made within the limits established in the Remuneration Policy are detailed in the 2022 Annual Report on Director Remuneration (ARR 2022), and can be found on the CNMV website and on the company website.
As regards variable remuneration, both annually (VAR) and in the Medium Term (MTI), the Remuneration Policy contains an explanation of its purpose, maximum amounts, targets and metrics, and the way that it operates.
The targets for both VAR and MTI include amounts relating to ESG.
A breakdown of the annual targets set for VAR to accrue while this Policy remains in force is included in the relevant Annual Report on Director Remuneration (ARR) for each financial year.
The Remuneration Policy establishes the remuneration system for the position of (non-executive) Chair of the Board of Directors.
Board of Directors and its Committees The Board of Directors and its Committees, along with the Steering Committee constitute Indra s governing bodies.
The duties of the Board and its Committees are set out in the Board Regulations, which implement the provisions of the Bylaws.
The Board focuses on supervising and controlling the executive bodies and the Steering Committee, to which it delegates the company s day-to-day management.
The aim of the 2020-2023 Sustainability Master Plan is to define and gain approval of ESG objectives from Indra s governing bodies.
Articles 21 to 26 of the Bylaws and sections II, III and X of the Board Regulations govern the Board of Directors  duties, the remit within which it can act, its qualitative and quantitative composition, and the various director roles and their duties.
The structure, composition, duties and rules of operation of the Board and its Committees are also outlined in sections C.1 and C.2 of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
Composition of the Board [GRI 405-1] The Director Selection Policy sets out the principles, criteria and basic prerequisites for the selection of directors.
It incorporates the mandate given Independent directors on the to the Board and the ARCGC to particularly ensure that Directors are Board of Directors selected in accordance with a policy that aims to promote an appropriate 50% Board composition, as well as diversity of knowledge, experience, age, gender and culture, and that also aims to avoid biases that may lead to No.
women as a percentage of discrimination.
total no.
Independent directors The composition of the Board of Directors that resulted from the events 57% occurring at the last Ordinary General Shareholders  Meeting (which are explained below) along with the exit from the company of former CEO Cristina Ruiz, mean that there is a lower percentage of women on the Board (28.57%), though women currently account for 57.14% of the total number of independent directors.
The professional profiles of the members of the Board and its Committees, as well as those of the Steering Committee, are public and always kept updated on the company website.
The Board s skills matrix, included in Appendix 11.6 of this Report, is also regularly updated to reflect the experience and knowledge that the Board of Directors should have.
It is a key tool that facilitates an overview of the diversity of the Board s composition as a whole and that is used when making decisions on the planning and renewal of the Board s membership.

Ignacio Mataix will continue to perform his current duties in order to facilitate the succession process and provide continuity in the company s management until a new CEO is appointed.
An independent consultant will be involved in the selection of the new CEO.
After this, Mr Mataix will continue to render his services to the company as a strategic advisor to the Board of Directors for a period of two years.
Indra believes that an appropriate representation of independent members1 on its Board and Committees allows it to guarantee the protection of both shareholder and stakeholder interests, to allow for a better decision-making process and, in general, improve the company s performance.
1 Definition of the concept of an independent director.
As a listed Spanish company, Indra is subject to various regulations.
As regards the independence of board members, the Spanish Companies Act establishes a definition of this category of member in Article 529 clause twelve under which 50% of Indra s Board comprises independent members.
Sustainability Report 2022 20 Sustainability Report 2022 As a result, and as outlined in Article 8 of the Board of Directors Regulations, Indra s aim is that the proprietary and independent members comprise an ample majority of the members of its governing bodies, and the number of executive directors is kept to the necessary minimum.
On 21 April 2022, the former CEO Cristina Ruiz Ortega submitted her resignation following the termination by mutual agreement of the executive services contract that bound the parties, with the Board of Directors agreeing (following a report from the ARCGC) to appoint Luis Abril Mazuelas as Executive Director and IT Managing Director by co-option procedure.
On 28 April 2022, and at the proposal of the ARCGC, the Board of Directors agreed to appoint Francisco Javier Garc a Sanz as independent director by co-option procedure, in order to fill the vacancy generated following the resignation submitted by Santos Mart nez-Conde Guti rrez-Barqu n in December 2021.
Proposals for the ratification, re-election and appointment of members of the board were submitted to the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Indra Sistemas, S.A. held on 23 June 2022.
The proposal for the re-election of Isabel Torremocha Ferrezuelo as an independent director was subject to a vote, though this was not approved as it failed to receive a sufficient majority of votes.
At this meeting, the shareholder Amber Selective Opportunities Fund II also proposed, as items that had not been included on the Agenda, that votes be held on its proposals for resolutions to end the mandates of Alberto Terol Esteban, Carmen Aquerreta Ferraz, Enrique de Leyva P rez and Ana de Pro Gonzalo, all of whom were independent directors, and these resolutions were approved by a sufficient majority of votes.
Subsequently, on 25 June 2022, Silvia Iranzo Guti rrez submitted her resignation as director.
While it respected the minimum number of members established in Article 21 of the Bylaws, the composition of the Board of Directors that resulted from the events occurring at the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting mentioned above, as well as the subsequent resignation of Silvia Iranzo, was not in line with Indra's commitment to comply with the recommendations set out in the Code of Good Governance for Listed Companies with regard to independence.
As such, the Board of Directors agreed to take the actions necessary in order to restore Indra s corporate governance structure and begin a process for the selection of independent directors, led by the current independent directors with specialist advice from a consultant.
The aim of this process is to ensure a qualitative composition of the Board in which at least half of its members are independent and, preferably, women.
The Board also agreed that the independence of the candidates resulting from this process would be subject to a subsequent verification process, which was entrusted to Ernst and Young.
On 27 June 2022, the independent director Ignacio Mart n San Vicente informed the Board of Directors of his decision to submit his resignation as director, with his resignation becoming effective as of 27 October once the independent director selection process had been completed.
The Extraordinary General Shareholders  Meeting held on 28 October 2022 approved the proposed appointment of the following independent directors with a sufficient majority of votes in favour: Ms Amatriain Corbi, Ms Arce Peralta, Ms Armero Montes, Ms San Jacinto Mart nez, Mr Arendt and Mr Villaz n Gil.
It also approved the appointment of proprietary director Juan Moscoso del Prado Hern ndez, at the request of the shareholder SEPI.
It should be indicated that the guiding principle in the selection of independent directors was to comply with the skills matrix and it has been very difficult to identify and attract a higher number of women candidates with the relevant knowledge and experience who adequately meet the requirements of the matrix and who have the necessary availability to join Indra s Board of Directors in the short term, other than those proposed to the General Shareholders  Meeting.
However, as indicated above, female independent directors currently account for 57.14% of the total number of independent directors.
With regard to the composition of the Board s Committees, it should be emphasised that all of them except for the Strategy Committee are chaired by female independent directors.
The Auditing and Compliance, Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committees have a majority of independent directors.
Notwithstanding the separation of the roles of the Chair of the Board of Directors and the CEO, Indra believes it to be good practice to have a lead independent director who can perform key duties with regard to coordinating the non- executive directors and acting as a spokesperson for their concerns, as well as providing a channel through which shareholders who are not directly represented on the Board can submit their concerns, demands and requests to the Board on matters of Corporate Governance.
At present, the positions of deputy chair of the Board and lead independent director are held by Virginia Arce.
Sustainability Report 2022 21 Sustainability Report 2022 Board member training Indra understands the need to offer board members training to help them stay up-to-date and improve their knowledge in their various areas of responsibility.
This ensures a critical opinion and adds value to decision-making.
The training offered to the members includes technical content and facilitates an in-depth understanding of Indra s business model, its strategy and management systems, and helps to complement members  skills in key areas such as risk management, cybersecurity, sustainability and Climate Change.
In 2022, as a consequence of the renewal of the Board of Directors referred to above, Indra organised a comprehensive onboarding process aimed at all the members of the Board of Directors.
The purpose of this process, which was spread over a number of sessions, was to support the incorporation of new board members and update the know-how of existing members (refresher programme).
In 2022, the Board organised onboarding sessions including content such as risk management, cybersecurity and sustainability Board members also took part in a session focusing on the issue of risk management (cybersecurity).
With regard to risk, in its annual distribution of duties, the Auditing and Compliance Committee expects sessions to be once again attended by the owners of the main (financial and non-financial) risks affecting the company, so that they can further enhance their understanding and oversee their management systems.
The results of this oversight are reported to the Board, which is ultimately responsible for Risk Control and Management Policy and for approving the Global Risk Maps.
The Board is regularly informed about the methodology applied when preparing risk maps, the circumstances that affect levels of risk and any other incident relating to this issue.
Meanwhile, the company leaves the possibility open for board members to contact Indra s managers to complete the information they could need in order to fulfil their duties.
Activity of governing bodies in 2022 The Annual Corporate Governance Report, as well as the operating reports of the Auditing and Compliance Committee, the Appointments, Attendance at Board and Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee and the Sustainability Committee meetings Committee, which are published when the Ordinary General Shareholders  100% Meeting is called, contain extensive information regarding the activity of Indra s governing bodies during the year, along with information regarding the company s level of compliance with the recommendations in force regarding Corporate Governance.
Regarding the dedication of the directors, and as set out in detail in the Annual Corporate Governance Report, in 2022 individual attendance was very high, evidence of a very satisfactory level of dedication and commitment.
Assessment of the Board In accordance with Article 13 of the Board of Directors Regulations, based on the report drawn up by the Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board carries out an annual assessment of its own operations and the quality of its work, as well as that of each of its Committees.
Information related to the assessments carried out in 2022 is included in section C.1.17 of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
To complete the assessment the Board regularly seeks the support of an independent external advisor.
The last external assessment of the Board, completed in February 2023 in relation to 2022, was carried out by consultancy firm KPMG, which was involved in the 2020 and 2021 assessments.
Given the recent changes in the composition of the company s Board of Directors, the ARCGC agreed to hire the firm once again.
The assessment is organised and coordinated by the Chair of the Board together with the chairmen/women of all Board committees, as well as by the lead independent director in the case of the evaluation of the Chair of the Board.
Sustainability Report 2022 22 Sustainability Report 2022 4 Ethics and transparency 4.1 Ethics and compliance [GRI 2-15] [GRI 2-16] [GRI 2-23] [GRI 2-24] [GRI 2-25] [GRI 2-26] [GRI 2-27] Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance Indra s Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance provides an irrefutable reference framework and establishes the operational principles and the rules of conduct that must be observed by all the company s employees and partners.
The Board of Directors, Senior Management and each and every one of Indra s employees and partners assume the responsibility and commitment to establish a robust culture of compliance.
The Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance applies to all Indra employees and its subsidiaries, suppliers and other third-party service providers, independent of the country they are operating in Compliance with the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance is a compulsory requirement for all Indra employees and partners and for all the companies in which it has shareholdings, either directly or indirectly.
In companies in which Indra has a minority shareholding or does not have operational control, the company ensures that the Code of Ethics and/or management principles applied by these companies are aligned with Indra s own Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance.
The Code reflects the company s commitment to respect the UN s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, its International Declaration of Human Rights, the principles relating to the rights established in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization and the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact.
Criminal risk prevention model [GRI 205-1] [GRI 205-2] Indra has a Model for the organisation, prevention, management and control of criminal risks which is outlined in: i) the Criminal Risk Prevention Manual for Spain, the latest edition of which was approved by the Board of Directors in July 2019; and ii) the Criminal Risk Prevention Manual for international subsidiaries, the latest edition of which was approved by the administrative bodies of the subsidiaries and the representatives of the international branches in November 2021.
The Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance acts as the fundamental control of the Model, the main components of which include:   The Criminal Risk Prevention Manuals for   Internal procedure relating to corporate Spain and for international subsidiaries acquisitions and transfers and mergers with third parties   Direct Channel   Third-party reputational risk   Compliance Unit   Training   Risk assessment and auditing of compliance controls   Evaluation of performance and remuneration The Criminal Risk Prevention Manuals for Spain and for international subsidiaries The Criminal Risk Prevention Manuals for Spain and international subsidiaries establish the model for the organisation, prevention, management and control of criminal risks (and administrative risks similar to criminal ones); the control, supervision and monitoring bodies; the financial resources management system; the disciplinary system; the complaints channel; training; and the controls to prevent any criminal offences (including administrative offences similar to criminal ones) being committed.
The Model, which is regularly reviewed, was updated in November 2021 in the latest edition of the Criminal Risk Prevention Manual for international subsidiaries.
The most significant changes included updating the method used to identify and value risks and strengthening the role of the control bodies for Indra s international subsidiaries and branches.
Model for the Prevention of Competition Law Risk Indra has a Model for the organisation, prevention, management and control of anti-competitive risks to which the company is exposed and has introduced measures to avoid incurring these risks in practices which infringe the applicable legislation in terms of competition.
The Model is contained in the Manual for the prevention of competition Sustainability Report 2022 23 Sustainability Report 2022 law risks in Spain, the rest of the European Union and Norway, in the Manual for the prevention of competition law risk for international subsidiaries (with the exception of the EU and Norway) and in the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance, which acts as the fundamental control of the Model.
Manuals for the Prevention of Competition Law Risks Both Manuals establish the model for the organisation, prevention, management and control of competition risks; the control, supervision and monitoring bodies; the financial resources management system; the disciplinary system; the complaints channel; training; and the controls to prevent any competition law infringements.
The Model, which is regularly reviewed, was updated in September and October 2021 when the Manual for the prevention of Competition Law risks for international subsidiaries (with the exception of the EU and Norway) was published after having been approved by the administrative bodies of the subsidiaries in November 2021, and when the Manual for the prevention of Competition Law risks for Spain, the rest of the EU and Norway was amended.
The most significant amendments included updating the method used to identify and value risks.
Indra commits to compliance with the regulations and principles of free competition in all the markets in which it operates, competing on an equal footing and avoiding any distortion which would hinder effective competition in those markets.
The Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance establishes that Indra s employees and partners should avoid all collusive conduct and practices which might in any way target restricting or distorting free competition.

However, the relevant measures may be taken against anyone who acts in bad faith with the aim of spreading information that is false or harmful to other people.
Compliance Unit The Compliance Unit establishes, coordinates and executes a series of measures and procedures to control, prevent and detect unethical conduct, ethical or criminal violations or irregularities and infringements or irregularities in terms of the Competition Law, at global level.
It reports directly and exclusively to the Auditing and Compliance Committee and is an area which is completely independent from the rest of the company.
Within the international subsidiaries, their respective governing bodies are the chief supervisors of the Models for the prevention of criminal and competition risks locally.
The duties performed by directors are carried out in accordance with the general principles and criteria established by the Auditing and Compliance Committee to govern regulatory compliance at a global level.
The Criminal Risk Management Compliance System is certified by AENOR under the UNE 19601 standard in Spain, while in Italy, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru the Anti-Bribery Management System is certified under the ISO 37001 standard In 2022, Indra Colombia and Indra Mexico, as well as several subsidiaries and branches in both countries were certified for the first time under the ISO 37001 standard  Anti-Bribery Management Systems , with the company s Compliance culture being highlighted as one of its most notable strengths.
The ISO 37001 certification of several subsidiaries and branches of Indra Brazil and Indra Peru was also renewed.
Towards the end of 2022, work to become ISO 37001 certified in Italy was also undertaken, with AENOR awarding the certification in January 2023.
Sustainability Report 2022 25 Sustainability Report 2022 Risk assessment and auditing of compliance controls Indra has a Global Risk Map which identifies the most significant risks in each category, including regulatory compliance, as well as the principal mitigation plans.
The Map is presented to the Auditing and Compliance Committee and the Risk Coordination Unit.
In addition, Indra has criminal and competition risk maps, which are also presented to the Audit and Compliance Committee.
In 2022, the methodology used to evaluate risks was updated, one of the benefits of this being that the risk map for Spain and for all the international subsidiaries be addressed just once and annually.
The Compliance Unit also carried out its own annual assessment of certain criminal and competition controls in 2022 as per the established procedure.
The assessment of the design and operation of the controls produced a satisfactory outcome and met the requirement to carry out a two-yearly self-assessment, in 2021 and 2022, of all the criminal and competition controls.
Lastly, in September 2022 the Internal Audit area carried out a review of the effectiveness of certain criminal and competition controls.
Internal procedure relating to corporate acquisitions and transfers and mergers with third parties This procedure governs the acquisition and/or transfer of companies and/or businesses, and mergers between third parties and any of the companies belonging to the Indra Group.
It establishes an obligation to complete a full due diligence process in order to gain a detailed understanding of the business, and of the most relevant compliance, finance, tax, legal, employment and administrative aspects.
In 2022, the Compliance Unit implemented third-party reputational due diligences (suppliers, partners, partners of temporary consortia (UTEs) and potential clients), specifically aimed at criminal and competition risks Third-party reputational risk The company s internal regulations for contracting commercial consultants, strategic advisors and suppliers establish, as a requirement before they are engaged, that a report must be prepared on reputational risk and must identify any  Politically Exposed Persons  (PEP).
In addition, the internal regulations on tendering require the receipt of a prior client reputation analysis in the case of countries that are at risk according to the Corruption Perceptions Index.
Training Indra is continually working to raise awareness of the Models for the Prevention of Criminal and Competition Risks and the Code of Ethics and Employees trained in ethics and Legal Compliance, both among its own employees and among suppliers.
All compliance new company employees must complete compulsory Ethics and Competition 97% training.
The Models for the Prevention of Criminal and Competition Risks envisage Suppliers trained in ethics and that training in Ethics and Competition must be provided to all employees at compliance (91% of purchases) sufficiently regular intervals to ensure that their knowledge is kept up to date.
100% Since 2019, the company has made a concerted effort to provide as many employees as possible with training.
At the end of 2022, 97% of the workforce had received training on Ethics and Competition.
The Compliance Unit also provided training sessions in Ethics and Competition for employees at the subsidiaries in Germany, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, United Arab Emirates, Slovakia, Latvia, Italy, Mexico, Peru and Spain (employees of ALG, Mobbeel, Aplicaciones de Simulaci n Simtek, Morpheus Aiolos and The Overview Effect).
Sessions to raise awareness regarding Ethics and Competition were also held for the Management teams of the Minsait and Transport and Defence divisions.
In 2022, more than 55,000 employees received training in Ethics and Competition In April 2021, a training document containing information related to Ethics and Compliance   which must be accepted by Indra s suppliers   was included in the terms and conditions to authorise suppliers and orders.
This document makes reference to aspects related to the rejection of corruption and bribery, conflicts of interest, corporate hospitality and the Direct Channel.
Sustainability Report 2022 26 Sustainability Report 2022 Evaluation of performance and remuneration Since 2020, Indra s performance evaluation system   Performance Talent   has included criteria related to knowledge of the company s Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance and required the completion of the obligatory course in Ethics and Competition.
It is worth noting that the results of the performance assessment have a bearing on the possibility of promotion and on determining employee remuneration.
Anti-corruption [GRI 205-1] [GRI 205-2] Indra rejects corruption and any illegal practice and is committed to complying with the law.
The company s Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance defines what is meant by corruption and bribery, including the basis of the anti-corruption policy.
Indra s Criminal Risk Prevention Model establishes certain controls that are regularly carried out within the different departments of the company to mitigate these risks.
These controls are carried out via multiple internal policies and procedures related to, among others, the following departments:   Procurement: Procedure for the Screening and   Bids: Internal regulations of the Tendering and Standardisation of Suppliers and chains of Procedural Committee for the control and authorisation for the issuance of purchase orders monitoring of bids and Temporary Consortia and Management of PEP-related issues with (UTEs) in their Spanish acronym.
suppliers.
Strategy: Policy on the Authorisation of Donations   Corporate takeovers and operations: Procedure and Sponsorships.
for Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions.
Administration: Procedure for Employee   Markets: Procedures for Hiring Commercial Expenses and Business Gifts.
Consultants and Strategic Advisors.
Finally, the regulation on PEPs (politically exposed persons) is also included in the procedures to regulate the company s relationships with third parties that may be regarded as PEPs.
Money laundering Via its Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance, Indra expresses its commitment to comply with all the current national and international standards and regulations concerning the prevention of money laundering (and the financing of terrorism).
For this purpose, it undertakes not to engage in practices that might be regarded as irregular vis- -vis its relationships with its clients and suppliers.
The company has developed internal procedures with controls to mitigate the risk of money laundering, especially with regard to cash payments.
Incidents of anti-competitive practices and action taken in response [GRI 206-1] In recent years, the Spanish competition authority (CNMC) has published the following rulings against the company: file S/DC/0565/15  tenders for IT applications , file S/DC/0598/2016  rail electrification and electromechanics , and file S/DC/0627/18  consultancy firms .
Indra has actively collaborated with the CNMC in these proceedings with a view to clarifying the events forming the subject of investigation.
These three files ended with penalty decisions in 2018, 2019 and 2021.
These decisions are all currently being appealed via a contentious-administrative action filed with Section 6 of the Audiencia Nacional.
In the 2021 resolution, the CNMC acknowledges that the measures adopted by Indra in recent years are adequate for the detection of infringements in terms of the defence of competition and recognises that they reflect a true wish to comply with competition law, having modified its Prevention of Competition Law Risk Model to improve and fully adapt it to the CNMC s Guidelines governing competition regulation in compliance programmes.
Some of the measures adopted in the Manuals for the Prevention of Competition Law Risk include: i) the regular involvement of senior management in ensuring compliance with competition law as a  fundamental element of the company culture ; ii) general reinforcement of Manuals, ensuring an express reference to applicable local law is included; iii) restructuring of the risk catalogue and adding new risks; iv) the introduction of training courses as a parameter to be taken into consideration in annual employee performance reviews.
In this regard, the Model for the prevention of Competition Law risk is reviewed and updated regularly, as are the internal controls and procedures.
In terms of some of the other measures taken, the internal control mechanisms for UTEs/consortia and subcontracting have been reinforced, such that all the bids submitted using these means are subject to a specific legal control, with the internal procedures governing these matters being updated in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

Human Rights Policy Indra is aware of the impact it has on individuals, both as an employer and via the technological solutions it develops for its clients.
For this reason, in 2020, the Board of Directors approved a Human Rights Policy aimed at identifying and expanding the positive impacts it has on individuals across the entire value chain and at minimising the negative impacts.

This Policy reinforces Indra s commitment to ethical conduct already set out in its Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance, compliance with which is mandatory for all the company s employees and partners, as well in other corporate policies which protect the fundamental rights of individuals, either directly or indirectly.
The Human Rights Policy approved by the Board reflects the company s commitment to a sustainable development that is fair and inclusive The Policy describes the company s commitments and operational principles that also apply to the rest of the value chain, both in terms of suppliers and other types of business partners, as well as the main communication channels available to its stakeholders.
Sustainability Report 2022 28 Sustainability Report 2022 Due diligence regarding Human Rights As outlined in the Policy, in 2022, Indra updated its due diligence procedures for assessing adverse impacts regarding Human Rights.
As part of this process, the company updated how it identifies the most material risks, both in its own operations and in its value chain.
As set out in the company s legal framework, Indra analyses specific risks and carries out due diligence regarding certain potentially significant aspects related to Human Rights, such as labour conditions and rights, diversity and inclusion and information privacy.
In 2021, and in line with the framework established by the United Nations Global Compact, the company also carried out a Human Rights risk analysis across the six main geographies in which it operates: Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Mexico, Peru and the Philippines.
The data gathered regarding the practices at the subsidiaries in terms of fundamental rights, such as decent work, rest, children s rights, family time, the elimination of forced labour, freedom of association, collective bargaining, non-discrimination, equal remuneration and job opportunities and fair pay   were analysed in order to identify areas of risk management that could be improved and implement the necessary mitigation measures.
Due diligence regarding Human Rights Key elements Action taken The Human Rights Policy, drawn up under the supervision of the Sustainability Committee and Human Rights Policy approved by the Board of Directors in 2020, defines a governance model and sets out clear Since 2015, updated and responsibilities in terms of Human Rights.
Developed in collaboration with experts in Human Rights approved by the Board of from the Seres Foundation and in line with international standards and good practices, the policy Directors in November 2020 covers the entire value chain and is publicly available on the company website in both Spanish and English.
The policy is sent internally to all employees and externally to stakeholders.
Assessment of material Carried out regularly at a global level with the collaboration of external human rights experts (Seres topics Foundation in 2020) and with the leadership teams of the most important geographies also taking Regularly since 2017 part.
In 2021, the assessment was carried out in Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Mexico and Peru using the reference framework developed by the United Nations Global Compact.
Examples of action taken in 2022:   The Human Rights risk assessment updated as part of the company s global risk map update.
Requirements in terms of Human Rights with Suppliers included in the Procurement Terms and Conditions for all orders via the Supplier Sustainability Policy.

In progress since 2017   Annual report on performance in Human Rights through the Sustainability Report and up to date information published on the company website.
Dialogue with stakeholders through participation in initiatives like the Seres Foundation Human Rights Lab.
Mechanisms for claims The Direct Channel allows stakeholders to complain or enquire about any aspect related to ethics and complaints and compliance (and also about anything explicitly Human Rights related).
The way in which the In progress since 2017 Direct Channel works is described in detail in section 4.1 of this report.
Sustainability Report 2022 29 Sustainability Report 2022 Human Rights risk mitigation and remediation Indra s Direct Channel is the mechanism through which queries and communications relating to both the company s Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance and its Human Rights Policy should be received.
Following a review of the communications received through this channel, and described extensively in the Ethics and Compliance section of this report, Indra has determined that the Human Rights risks most likely to arise are those relating to harassment and unacceptable behaviour, discrimination, and information security.
As a result, Indra has gone to considerable effort in recent years to tighten up its control and mitigation measures for these types of risk:   In 2022, 97% of Indra's active workforce (as of 31 December) had received training in Ethics and Competition, which also covers topics relating to harassment and unacceptable behaviour, discrimination, and information security.
2021 saw a sustainability training plan with specific Human Rights content rolled out for all employees.
Specific sustainability-related content has also been made available to employees via the company s online training platform.
As part of the training catalogue made available to middle management and executives, the company offers special training aimed at combating discrimination in the workplace, including courses on performance evaluation and unconscious bias.
As described in more detail in the section on Information Security, Privacy and Data Protection, Indra provides new employees with mandatory training on information security, with yearly refresher courses for all personnel, and also offers a wide range of optional training resources.
Where there have been cases of these risks occurring, the company has taken remediation action, which has included both disciplinary and non-disciplinary measures being taken against the offending individuals.
These measures are described in the Ethics and Compliance section of this report.
In 2022, Indra received a complaint involving a violation of the right to privacy which had occurred while performing a service for a customer.
This incident is outlined in section 7.7 of this report.
Indra remediated the situation and compensated for any damages that may have resulted from the reported human rights violation by paying the corresponding penalty.
In the main geographies in which Indra operates (Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia), the company has subcontracted a security company whose staff3 have received Human Rights training.
4.3 Responsible taxation [GRI 207-1] Indra has a fiscal strategy and a governance model that ensures that tax activities are conducted within a framework founded on ethics, transparency and integrity.
[GRI 207-1] As indicated in the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance in relation to good tax practices, the company s business involves making a series of decisions that have an impact and effect on taxation.
As such, the company undertakes to comply with its tax obligations in all the territories and jurisdictions in which it operates, always pursing a prudent taxation policy.
The Tax Policy reflects the company s fiscal strategy and its commitment to the application of good tax practices, which applies to all Indra companies in all the countries in which it operates.
This Policy is annually reviewed by the Auditing and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors.
3 75 employees in Spain, 8 in Mexico and 17 in Colombia.
Sustainability Report 2022 30 Sustainability Report 2022 The following principles and commitments are defined as part of this Tax Policy, and they reflect the principles set out in the Code of Good Tax Practices:   Complying with tax regulations and obligations in both letter and spirit in the various countries and territories in which the Group operates, paying any taxes that are due in accordance with their respective tax requirements.
Promoting practices that are aimed at preventing and reducing significant tax risks, ensuring that tax payments properly reflect the structure and location of the Group s activities, its human and material resources and its levels of risk.
Adopting tax-related decisions on the basis of a reasonable interpretation of the regulations in force in respect of the company s activities.
Complying with the internal procedures established in relation to the taking of tax decisions and the procedures implemented to monitor tax risk.
Informing the Board of Directors of the principal tax implications of the operations or matters submitted for its approval, such as operations that do not fall within the ordinary course of the company s business, corporate restructuring processes, investments, or the opening of new businesses.
Applying the transfer prices in accordance with the principle of free competition, such that no significant inequalities are generated in commercial relations.
Not transferring value created to jurisdictions with a lower tax burden, not using tax structures that are opaque, artificial or that have no commercial basis and not using the secret of certain tax jurisdictions (referred to as tax havens) to avoid paying tax.
Tax risks are analysed, reviewed and managed as part of the risk management governance model.
In addition, Indra s Tendering Committee evaluates the tax risks of the bids submitted globally by the company, and seeks external advice for complex bids when required.
Governance of tax policy [GRI 207-2] Indra s General Finance Department, acting through the Group s Global Tax Department, is responsible for ensuring the proper application of the company s tax policy and for identifying and managing any potential associated risks.
The Tendering Committee, which the Finance Department forms part of, assesses the tax risk involved in the bids tendered by the company.
On a regular basis, and at least twice a year, the Tax Department reports to Indra s Auditing and Compliance Committee   the body appointed by the Board of Directors to oversee the management of tax matters and tax risk   on the company s performance in respect of tax-related issues.
In addition, the Auditing and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors must approve any significant company operation that implies the opening of new structures in countries regarded as tax havens in order to ensure that Indra s activities in those countries are strictly business-related.
The Auditing and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors maintain constant supervision of all tax management matters Tax management is subject to Indra s internal risk management system, and as a consequence it is submitted for close scrutiny by the Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Auditing Departments.
In this regard, the Direct Channel is available for any employee or external stakeholder who may wish to make any comment regarding the company s tax management.
Stakeholder relations [GRI 207-3] The tax undertakings that Indra sets out in its Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance in relation to its tax-related obligations in all the territories and jurisdictions where it operates and where it always pursues prudent tax policies also apply to its relations with external advisors in matters of tax policy.
Section 9.3 headed  Associations and foundations  contains a description of Indra s relations with organisations that could potentially be aimed at gaining political influence.
Indra s relations with these institutions are at all times governed by principles of both transparency and caution.
As explained in this section, Indra s main objectives relate to promoting technology-driven innovation and sustainable development.
Sustainability Report 2022 31 Sustainability Report 2022 Indra maintains collaborative relationships with the various Tax Authorities with which it comes into contact as the result of its business activities, based on principles of transparency and good faith.
The company promotes the transparent, clear and responsible communication of its main tax figures, through the forwarding to its various stakeholders of information relating to the payment of all the taxes that it is required to pay in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates.

The result that serves as the basis for calculating the accrued income tax expense differs from this amount, mainly due to the fact that this result (i) includes certain items (mainly dividends that have a limited tax impact) that have no tax impact, and (ii) does not include the results obtained through permanent establishments, which are taxed and have a tax impact in the country in which they are generated.
The effective payment made in Spain in the year amounts to  20,119 k  and corresponds to the aggregate balance of payments on account for the year ( 24,429 k ), withholdings paid on certain income and dividends and a net tax refund from previous years (amounting to  15,885 k ).

The total tax paid by the Group for the financial year, which amounted to  56 million, was not calculated on the consolidated reported profit of  256 million reflected in the annual accounts.
This consolidated reported profit was calculated by applying IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standard) and differs from the aggregate pre-tax result calculated in accordance with the Chart of Accounts applicable in each jurisdiction, which serves as the legal basis for calculating tax actually payable (the main difference being that goodwill is not amortised under IFRS, and the rest of consolidation adjustments).
The data reported by country relates to all the companies or permanent establishments (primarily branches) that are resident, for tax purposes, in that particular jurisdiction, regardless of where sale or purchase activity is actually carried out, except in cases where the company has permanent establishments located abroad.
In such cases, the corresponding figure is allocated to the country where the permanent establishment in question is located and registered for tax purposes.
According to the annual accounts, the consolidated pre-tax reported profit amounted to  255,761 thousand, entailing a corporate income tax expense of  80,172 thousand.
The earnings before tax, aggregated by country, amounted to a profit of  274,152 thousand, while the corporate income tax expense totalled  79,905 thousand.
This difference between the aggregate and consolidated figures is explained by the application of international accounting standards and the elimination of consolidated results (primarily dividends and portfolio adjustments).
For more information relating to tax status, see Note 35 and Appendix 1 of the Consolidated Annual Accounts.
Throughout 2022, Indra has carried out commercial projects in the following countries which are considered tax havens or non-cooperative jurisdictions, according to the latest listings published by the OECD, the European Union and the Spanish Tax Authority.
Sustainability Report 2022 34 Sustainability Report 2022 Such a presence is never for tax purposes and is always solely and exclusively due to the company s commercial activity, as detailed below:   Bahrain: Indra has one subsidiary   the opening of which was reported in the 2011 Annual Report   with more than 40 employees who provide support for a large healthcare project.
In addition, several energy projects have been developed for the Bahrain Electricity and Water Authority, and several air traffic projects have been set up for the Bahrain Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications.
Panama: Indra has one location in the country employing nearly 100 professionals, who carry out consulting, maintenance and migration work on applications and services for clients in the Public Administration and Financial Services sectors.
It has also carried out supervision, inspection and monitoring services for various works in the country.
Gibraltar: Indra has carried out the maintenance and application management of the airport systems installed at Gibraltar airport.
Liberia: the company has primarily been involved in managing energy projects for the Liberian Electricity Company.
In 2022, Indra also engaged in specific activities in countries or territories such as Turks and Caicos Islands, Vanuatu, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Jordan, Fiji, Seychelles, Macao, Guernsey, Trinidad and Tobago, Bahamas and Liechtenstein, which are also considered low taxation or non-cooperative jurisdictions according to the aforementioned institutions.
The amount that this business represents as a percentage of the company s total revenue is virtually insignificant and is due to the company's commercial activity and to specific projects, mainly in the consultancy and air traffic sectors.
Indra has also undertaken air traffic, defence and energy projects in Oman.
The country is, however, no longer considered a non-cooperative jurisdiction within the EU.
Indra is also engaged in various business activities in countries such as Malaysia, Morocco and Turkey that have reached agreements with the European Union to modify their tax legislation and bring it in line with European standards.
Finally, Indra did not create new structures in 2022 in any country listed as a tax haven or low-tax jurisdiction by the OECD, European Union or Spanish tax authorities.
Sustainability Report 2022 35 Sustainability Report 2022 5 Planet and Climate Change 5.1 Climate Change governance and management The Board and the Sustainability Committee are the most important decision-making and supervisory units at Indra in terms of Climate Change.
The sustainability management team reports regularly to the Sustainability Committee and to the Board on the policies, main risks and opportunities and the performance of the company s objectives in this respect.
In 2021, the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) formally approved the emissions reduction targets drawn up by the Sustainability Committee and approved by the Board of Directors in 2020.
Indra s emissions reduction targets were set using the method developed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in line with the 1.5 C COP26 commitments4 All aspects related to Climate Change are fully integrated into the company s strategy via the initiatives defined as part of the 2020-2023 Sustainability Master Plan framework, which contains a specific pillar for the Environment and Climate Change.
Indra s strategy insofar as the environment is concerned is based on identifying and analysing its main risks and opportunities, specifically: Climate Change risks and opportunities, environmental workplace risks and risks regarding compliance with environmental regulations.
In addition to the information contained within this section regarding Indra s performance in terms of environment- related matters, section 7 offers more information on Indra s contribution to the Climate Change mitigation and adaptation targets in line with the EU s Taxonomy criteria.
5.2 Climate Change risks and opportunities [GRI 201-2] In 2022, Indra updated its climate change risk and opportunity analysis   which forms part of its Corporate Risk Management and Control System   to include different scenarios in line with the recommendations issued by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures5 (TFCD) and with growing regulatory and capital market requirements, such as the supplement published on 20 June 2019 to the EU Guidelines on reporting of climate-related information (Climate Supplement).
Indra has taken four scenarios into consideration, both in qualitative and quantitative terms:   The International Energy Agency s STEPS (Stated Policies Scenario) a conservative scenario that does not take for granted that governments will reach all announced goals.
The International Energy Agency s 2DS (2DS): a scenario that describes a pathway in which the energy system is capable of limiting global warming to a 2 C rise in temperature   assigning this a probability of 80%.
The  very stringent  RCP 2.6 pathway and the  business as usual  RCP 8.5 pathway defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change6 (IPCC).
Within the scope of these two scenarios, Indra has assessed the risks and opportunities for its business both in terms of the transition and physical risks posed by Climate Change:   The transition risk analysis is designed to assess how Indra can shift towards a low-carbon economy.
To do this, the company has defined a strategy to combat Climate Change and set neutrality targets for 2050 which are in line with the main regulatory requirements in terms of energy efficiency and emissions reduction among others.
This strategy allows the company to mitigate the main risks in terms of its capital markets access, competitive position, social licence to operate and reputation.

6 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a United Nations intergovernmental organisation charged with advancing knowledge on Climate Change.
Sustainability Report 2022 36 Sustainability Report 2022   The physical risks analysis identifies the consequences that the gradual changes in weather conditions (temperature, rainfall, flooding) could have for the company in 2050 and the impact that other potential extreme weather-related phenomenon could have on its facilities and operations.
It also identifies the opportunities that the increased demand for solutions and services that allow clients to be more resilient against the physical effects of Climate Change offer the company.
A breakdown of the analysis completed, including a detailed description of the impacts of Climate Change on Indra s operations and the response measures adopted by the company is available on the company website.
The main climate-related risks and the response measures adopted by Indra are detailed below.
To find out more about the opportunities that Climate Change offers for the company and see how well aligned Indra s product offering is with the EU s Climate Taxonomy, please refer to section 7  Technology with impact .
5.3 Climate Change mitigation and adaptation The main transition risk for Indra is linked to the potential financial, reputational and competition-related impact associated with ever more stringent climate-related regulations across the world   particularly in the European Union, which aims to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
The 2020-2023 Sustainability Master Plan addresses the initiatives that are needed to reduce the company s GHG emissions, involving all the areas that are required to succeed in achieving them In 2020, the Sustainability Committee designed an ambitious emissions reduction roadmap for the company, which was approved in 2021 by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and sets science-based objectives for 2030 and 2040, with the intention of achieving carbon neutrality in 2050.

Indra recognises the agreements reached in the Paris Agreement and intends to be an active agent in this collective effort to reduce the impact of Climate Change.
To achieve this, it has a Climate Change strategy which sets out initiatives across four core areas:   Energy efficiency in the workplace: optimise electricity consumption and climate control.
Increase use of green energy.
Include environmental criteria in procurement procedures.
Actively encourage sustainable employee mobility: reduce business travel and commuting.

The return to more normal travel patterns following the pandemic has increased emissions from rail and air travel compared to 2021 (no.
of train and plane journeys up +85% and +110%, respectively).
Staff returning to the office has also led to higher workplace occupancy (rising from 15% to 32% globally), which has in turn resulted in increased emissions from commuting.
Of the remaining scope 3 categories, only the increase in emissions from  use of sold products  (Category 11) stands out, accounting for 18% of total emissions in 2022, up 77% from 2021.
The reason for this increase was the change in the mix of products sold.
In 2022, the number of product units delivered to clients in the Transportation sector increased (more than 5,300 units delivered in 2022, compared to 4,100 in 2021), while ATM radars with higher levels of energy consumption, such as the MSSR-S (Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Mode-S Radar) or the PSR2D (2D Primary Radar), have also been delivered.
Sustainability Report 2022 38 Sustainability Report 2022 Emission calculations are based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), the accounting and reporting standard created by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).
In 2022, Indra also obtained ISO 14064 Carbon Footprint certification from AENOR for the 2021 inventory of GHG emissions for seven group companies located in Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru7, which account for 76% of the group s total emissions.
The company plans to renew these certifications in 2023.
In 2022 energy consumption emissions (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) as a whole fell compared to 2021, after the following measures were implemented: the Property Efficiency Plan reduced energy consumption by cutting the area ISO 14064 certified emissions (sqm) in use; more than one million euros were invested in improving energy 76% efficiency (lighting and HVAC systems) at our sites in Spain and; the company increased its procurement of green energy, which accounted for 100% of all Investment in energy efficiency the energy consumed in Spain in 2022 and 16% of the energy consumed in measures in the workplace the company s other geographies (Italy, Portugal, Chile and Australia).
+  1 million Energy consumption emissions (scope 1 and 2) in main geographical areas The main source of energy consumption emissions is workplace electricity consumption, which accounts for 42% of Indra's total scope 1 and 2 emissions.
99.9% of the activity data used are primary data.
The opening of the new simulation centre in Coslada (Madrid), where a generator is temporarily being used to ensure a reliable supply of energy, has had a major impact on energy consumption emissions (8% of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions).
It is anticipated that the transformer station will be operational in 2023, which will allow renewable energy to be used to power the facilities.
The countries that make the largest contribution to the Group s carbon footprint in terms of energy consumption   gas, diesel, refrigerant gases and electricity   are: Spain (50%), Mexico (12%), Brazil (11%), Germany (7%), Portugal (6%), Colombia (5%) and Australia (4%).
All other regions represent less than 2% of its emissions.

Sustainability Report 2022 39 Sustainability Report 2022 The main categories contributing to scope 3 emissions in 2022 were: purchases (63%), use of sold products (18%), business travel (7%) and commuting (6%).
This represents a change in how these categories rank as a proportion of total Scope 3 emissions when compared with the base year (2019):   Use of sold products: the nature of Indra s business means that it sells a very diverse range of products intended to be used for the purposes of specific projects.
The emissions for this category therefore vary depending on the projects and products delivered in that year.
The proportion of emissions coming from the use of sold products (Category 11) has increased, with these now representing 18% of all scope 3 emissions (compared to 8% in 2019).
Business travel and employee commuting: the proportion of emissions coming from journeys made by Indra s workforce was far higher in 2019 than it is today.
The move towards more sustainable transport and cutting down on the amount of journeys to and from work has reduced this to a smaller proportion of the company s total indirect emissions.
Scope 3 emissions are calculated using a combination of quantification methods depending on the primary data available.
Different emission factors were used depending on the source data and the calculation method.
All the information on the emission factors used in these calculations can be found in Appendix 11.6.
Distribution of Scope 3 emissions by category Other categories; 6% Use of sold products (category 11); 18% Commuting Purchases of (category 7); 6% goods and services (category 1); 63% Business travel (category 6); 7% Main factors driving reductions in Scope 3 indirect emissions Measures have continued to be implemented in 2022 to reduce both Scope 3 emissions and uncertainties in their calculation.
These have included: the campaign to collect Carbon Footprint data from 100+ key suppliers, selected for their emission intensity; the use of primary data on business travel at Indra companies, taken from employee expense data; and the introduction of a product lifecycle management (PLM) tool to collect data on the energy consumption of products sold.
Equally of note in 2022 have been the sustainable transport initiatives introduced in Italy and Colombia.
In Italy, Indra has reached agreements with external suppliers, allowing it to offer its workforce the option of carpooling to work or using hybrid rental cars for business trips.
While in Colombia, Indra has completely offset the carbon footprint associated with trips its personnel made using taxis.
As a result of all the measures implemented and improvements made, in 2022 scope 3 emissions fell by 25% compared to 2019   the base year used to calculate the emissions reduction targets.
Two main factors have driven reductions in Scope 3 indirect emissions in 2022:   Environmental and Carbon Footprint criteria for suppliers: In order to involve its suppliers in the process of fulfilling its environmental commitments, Indra has developed a Supplier Sustainability Policy which focuses on their climate performance.
The company s aim is to use the best suppliers from a climate perspective, and to work with key suppliers to improve their climate practices.
With this in mind, a tool was introduced in 2022 to assess ESG risks and collect environmental information on suppliers: CO2 emissions, use of renewable energy and SBTs for reducing emissions.
Training workshops on the subject of carbon footprint were also organised for key suppliers in Spain, and these will continue to run in 2023.
For more information, see section 7.8.
Change in workforce travel patterns: As a result of the pandemic, Indra s workforce has adopted new travel and remote work patterns, which have reduced the need for business trips (CO2 emissions down 68% from 2019) and commuting (CO2 emissions down 40% from 2019).
Sustainability Report 2022 40 Sustainability Report 2022 Internal carbon pricing project As part of the 2020-2023 Sustainability Master Plan, the company created an internal carbon pricing project in 2021 with the aim of measuring and assigning prices to the Group s CO2 emissions.
Indra aims to align its value chain with the Group s emissions reduction targets, making the CO emissions factor part of its decision-making 2 procedures The aim of the project, which is supported by the Sustainability Committee, is to incorporate the  CO2 factor  into its business processes and decision-making procedures and by doing so encourage the implementation of greenhouse gas emission reduction measures.

In order to calculate this price, the social cost of carbon together with the average price of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) were used as references.
In the future, it may be possible to calculate the internal price of Indra s carbon using the internal fee model instead of the shadow pricing model, which would in turn allow the carbon tax to be used to finance offsetting initiatives for the company s waste emissions9.

Sustainability Report 2022 41 Sustainability Report 2022 Energy efficiency and purchasing green energy [GRI 302-1] [GRI 302-2] [GRI 302-3] [GRI 302-4] Improving energy efficiency and increasing the purchase of green energy are Indra s two key focus areas for reducing the Group s scope 1 and 2 emissions   namely direct and indirect emissions from energy consumption.
Over the years, a number of energy optimisation measures have been implemented at the sites occupied by Indra, including: heating, air Renewable energy consumed conditioning, climate control, insulation, lighting and space optimisation.
The 88% results of these measures can be seen in the reduction of Indra s environmental footprint.
Emissions intensity by energy The corporate headquarters in Alcobendas (Madrid) is the group s highest consumption per employee capacity location.
The building is LEED Gold certified   the US Green 0.053 Building Council s accreditation system for sustainable buildings   and has been certified under the European EMAS and ISO 50001 standard designed to ensure continual improvement in energy efficiency.
The corporate headquarters houses the Energy Control Centre, which remotely controls and monitors the energy consumption of 92% of the group s various head offices in Spain   equating to more than 80% of Indra s total energy consumption globally.
Indra s Energy Control Centre allows the company to maintain and improve the energy saving levels of the Group s various head offices in Spain.
To do this, it applies mathematical models to real-time consumption data to produce forecasts for energy and power consumption.
The energy consumption control systems located at Indra s facilities are programmed, reviewed and adjusted daily in accordance with occupancy levels, peaks in activity, working schedules and weather, among other factors.
This allows any deviations to be corrected and the consumption curve maintained at the optimal level for energy savings, therefore achieving greater energy efficiency at its facilities.
More than 80% of Indra s total workplace energy consumption is centrally tracked and controlled online The Energy Control Centre programmes the measures that are directly implemented at its facilities by technicians specialising in energy efficiency.
The performance of the key production units in each of its main headquarters are also monitored, working with maintenance technicians to decide the best improvement measures based on the time of year in question.
The company also uses portable consumption measuring equipment to take one-off measurements in order to assess the level of energy deviation caused by changes in its business operations: power increases/decreases, changes in office occupancy levels and in working hours, etc.
All these energy efficiency measures have been key in optimising post-pandemic energy consumption, a time when workplace occupancy has varied greatly.
Green energy accounts for 100% of Indra s workplace energy consumption in Spain and Italy, with this percentage reaching 88% at the global level Another energy efficiency measure that Indra has set out as a key objective in its Sustainability Master Plan is to increase the purchase of green energy to 100% in Spain by 2023 and to 85% at the global level by 2030.
Since 2019, Indra has been gradually increasing the percentage of renewable energy used at the global level, taking it up to 88% in 2022.
Spain (100%) and Italy (100%) are the two leading geographies in terms of the Group s green energy consumption.
In addition, in 2022 the company began using green energy in Chile (95%), Portugal (88%) and Australia (10%).
Indra s aim is to increase its green energy consumption in these countries and gradually roll this out to other countries.
Circular economy [GRI 306-2] As a high value-add technology provider, Indra offers a wide range of proprietary solutions.
Given the specific nature of its products, the company understands that its main contribution to helping create a circular economy is as follows:   Improving durability: Many of the products and services Indra provides, particularly in certain segments of the Transport and Defence sectors, require critical use.
This is true of integrated systems and those intended for intensive round-the-clock use.
Products are therefore designed to have a long service life of 10 to 20 years, and are highly reusable, upgradeable and repairable.
Sustainability Report 2022 42 Sustainability Report 2022   Reducing the presence of hazardous chemical substances: The eco-design approach determines which materials and products to use while also laying out the technical criteria for their manufacture and use.
Increasing the recycled content and enabling high-quality remanufacturing and recycling: The solutions Indra provides are products composed principally of hardware and electronics.
These parts can be readily recovered at the end of the product s service life, meaning that on average, 94% of its components by weight can be reused or recycled.
Increasing energy efficiency and reducing the company s carbon footprint.
Indra has incorporated circular economy thinking into its processes and products In the course of its R&D processes aimed at identifying general solutions, and particularly those that may include electronic devices, Indra considers responsible design principles with a view to:   Ensuring consumer health and safety using its quality management system, which is based on the highest international standards.
Eliminating hazardous content in accordance with European RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) legislation by performing supplier audits and following CE certification procedures.
Reducing the use of resources by applying LEAN principles during the design process and eliminating the use of resources from conflict-affected areas, as set out in the company s Sustainability Policy.
Reducing and responsibly managing electronic waste using the LEAN approach and the company s environmental management system, and facilitating collection of the waste generated by its products once they have reached the end of their service life.
Ensuring the accessibility of its products and services, and undertaking to develop accessible technologies as part of its social action programmes.
In 2022, Indra implemented a plan to increase the eco-design of its products.
Phase I of the plan involved launching a pilot project aimed at incorporating eco-design techniques into the design process for the company s radars, starting with the PSR2D NEO.
The aim of these techniques is to reduce the environmental impact of the radar over its lifecycle, continually improving its performance without affecting quality or its applications.
In order to achieve this, a detailed LCA (life cycle assessment) was carried out using standardised methodology to identify and make improvements aimed at reducing its environmental impact, as well as analyse its carbon footprint and other associated types of impact.
This has allowed the company to identify eco-design methods and strategies that might be extrapolated to other areas and products.
Other initiatives are also being introduced to Indra s Engineering and Technology processes in order to incorporate sustainability criteria into the design and development process:   Updates to the product catalogue to include information on a product s energy consumption, service life and weight.
Adjustments to product design, NPI (new product introduction) and gate review procedures following an evaluation.
Automatic environmental footprint calculation being added to the PLM (product lifecycle management) tool.
Training and awareness-raising campaigns.
Marketing and promotion of products whose design process has already been improved from an environmental standpoint.
In 2022 Indra finalised the improvement and automation project aimed at complying with the REACH Regulation regarding the use of dangerous and toxic chemicals.
As such, internal tools have been implemented that allow project managers to trace the presence of banned substances in the products and components manufactured by Indra via alerts that are generated when any such substance is present.
Indra's business activity does not tend to generate large volumes of waste.
Non-hazardous waste (kg) Hazardous waste at the production sites, all of which are ISO 14001 certified, 91% accounts for 62% of the total hazardous waste generated at the Spanish centres in Spain, with electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) being the most representative.
Indra is committed to the circular economy and to Hazardous waste (kg) recycling and/or reusing all waste generated by the group, based on the 9% principles of prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling, and other forms of recovery and disposal.

Indra aims to recover all its waste and, where possible, retrieve and recycle as much of it as possible.
As such, the company prioritises the hiring of local waste managers to maximise the proportion of waste recovered and recycled.
89% of the Group s global waste comes from facilities located in Spain; this waste is treated by authorised waste managers using various methods (reuse, recycling, incineration or landfill).
Of the Group's total waste, 58% was recycled or reused in centres in Spain10.
The company's waste accounts for less than 0.1% of its overall emissions.
Indra has set itself a target of reducing non-recoverable hazardous waste at its production sites by 20% by 2023 (18% in 2022) Indra s 2020-2023 Sustainability Master Plan includes a target to reduce hazardous non-recoverable waste from manufacturing centres by 20% by Hazardous waste recycled at 2023.
2022 saw the launch of a number of initiatives, in coordination with the production facilities in Spain (kg) environmental, quality and general services managers at Indra s production 78% sites, aimed at increasing the percentage of hazardous waste recovered.
Among the initiatives aimed at improving the recovery rates for hazardous waste, we would highlight the recovery of hazardous waste with very low (e.g. cutting fluids and developers11) to zero (e.g. tin dross, aqueous sludge) recycling rates, as well as the initiative to have waste treatment methods analysed by those responsible for this process.
As a result of these initiatives, the percentage of recycled or reused hazardous waste rose to 78% in 2022 (vs.
61% in 2020).
The amount of non-recoverable waste generated by the ten manufacturing centres in Spain12 fell by 18% compared to 2020.
Indra aims to eliminate single-use plastics from its offices The Sustainability Master Plan also targets the elimination of single-use plastics from its Spanish offices by 2023 and sets 2030 as the deadline for eliminating them from its offices at the global level.
10 In Spain, 65% of waste is recycled or reused.
11 Cutting fluid is an oil- and water-based product used as a lubricant and coolant in metalworking processes.
12 Manufacturing sites located in Spain: Aranjuez, Torrej n, San Fernando, Bembibre, Ferrol, Fuente  lamo, Puerto de Santa Mar a, Nave Lean, Sierra de Guadarrama and the Coslada Simulation Centre (up and running since September 2022) Sustainability Report 2022 44 Sustainability Report 2022 Measures implemented to eliminate single-use plastics to date include:   Replacement of single-use plastics in office caf s and coffee corners with more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as bamboo cutlery (Spain, Brazil), porcelain or paper cups and glasses (Colombia), glass jugs (Portugal, Italy) and takeaway food containers made from compostable fibres (Spain).
The company is also working to find alternatives to the plastic bottles sold in vending machines (Spain and Portugal).
In Spain, the plastic water bottles sold in vending machines are all made from 100% recyclable PET, and sources of drinking water have been adapted at all our sites to ensure accessibility.
Reduction in the use of plastics in packaging at production sites, and wherever possible, their replacement with non-disposable alternatives.

Any such weather phenomena could restrict access to the company s facilities, damage equipment, cause power cuts to the electricity supply and telecommunications networks or affect the company s utility supply.
Indra has defined the following measures to manage the physical risks associated with Climate Change:   Property resilience: Indra takes the risks of exposure to weather phenomena into account when selecting its properties.
It also establishes additional requirements for work centres and facilities situated in locations that are at high risk of being affected by extreme weather phenomena.
Continuity and disaster recovery plans.
Operation decommissioning.
Option to both work and certify project milestones remotely.
Insurance policies insuring against physical damage to the company s buildings and facilities.
Sustainability Report 2022 45 Sustainability Report 2022 Water consumption [GRI 303-1] [GRI 303-2] [GRI 303-3] Despite the fact that the company s activities have not been identified as having a significant environmental impact in terms of water consumption, availability and quality, managing its water resources efficiently is also part of Indra s strategy.
This is why the company monitors, manages and sets targets for minimising the consumption of water at certain sites.
The efficient management of water consumption is particularly relevant given that Climate Change is expected to exacerbate water stress.
Efficient water use is therefore an important way of preventing potential water shortages in the communities where Indra operates, while consequently mitigating the potential risks associated with any water rationing measures imposed by Public Administrations.
Some of its specific initiatives aimed at minimising water consumption include the installation of water-saving mechanisms at the company s facilities and actions carried out to raise awareness of responsible use of water among employees.
Biodiversity and land use, atmospheric emissions, and contamination [GRI 303-1] [GRI 303-2] [GRI 303-3] The impact for Indra on biodiversity and ecosystems, atmospheric emissions, and soil, water and aquifer contamination, has not been deemed to be significant.
Nevertheless, the initiatives introduced as part of the company s Sustainability Master Plan and Environmental Management System are having a positive impact in terms of preventing contamination and protecting biodiversity and ecosystems.
For example:   The measures implemented at its ISO 14001-certified locations to prevent spills and uncontrolled dumping, and the training provided and drills on the procedures to follow in case of an environmental emergency, have significantly reduced the risk of contamination to soils and water, thus avoiding negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystems.
Due to the nature of its business and location of its sites, and thanks to its Workspace Optimisation Plan, Indra s land use is not intensive, meaning that its contribution to soil and ecosystem degradation is minimal.
Moreover, given the nature of the company s work, it does not use any ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), nor does it produce any significant emissions of polluting gases, such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), or particulates.
In addition, Indra participates in local projects to protect biodiversity.
These include reforesting initiatives and schemes to clean up natural environments and collect plastics.
For more information, see Appendix 11.6.
Nature-based solutions [GRI 303-1] [GRI 303-2] [GRI 303-3] Indra recognises the importance of nature in the fight against Climate Change and water stress.
As a result, through the technology solutions it develops for its clients, the company helps create healthy ecosystems, develop infrastructure that is compatible with nature, and reduce the risk of environmental disasters.
The following solutions are worth mentioning in this regard:   Sensor-based solutions (infrared cameras, meteorological radars and sensors) to monitor fossil fuel infrastructure in aquatic environments and automatically detect any leaks.
Counter-drone systems with advanced recognition capabilities to avoid false positives involving birds.
3D radars and visible-spectrum cameras to detect the trajectories of birds and avoid collisions with wind turbines.
Satellite data and imaging to detect climate risks.
Digital solutions that allow companies to include natural capital (biodiversity, climate, water and social well- being) as a parameter when assessing the operational impact of their assets and businesses.
Sustainability Report 2022 46 Sustainability Report 2022 5.4 Environmental management The Group s Sustainability Policy and Global Environmental Policy not only reflect its strategic priorities in this regard, but also its steadfast commitment ISO 14001 certified offices (*) with to protecting the environment and ensuring it makes continual improvement.
over 500 employees The Environmental Policy is implemented through the company's 85% Environmental Management System in accordance with ISO 14001 requirements and the EU s EMAS regulations.
ISO 14001 certified manufacturing Indra s goal is that by 2023 100% of the company s main facilities13 at global centres in Spain level are either certified or in the process of being certified under the ISO 100% 14001 standard.
At the close of 2022, 100% of its manufacturing centres in Spain and 85% of the group s offices were certified under this standard.
ISO 14001 certification requires high standards in a number of environmental areas such as carbon emissions, energy consumption, waste management, recycling, water use and employee awareness.
During the course of 2021 and 2022, the Environment Unit also carried out an environmental risk assessment at two locations with capacity for more than 500 employees in Mexico and the Philippines, meaning that the company has now conducted an environmental risk assessment on 100% of its work centres.
The assessments carried out in both countries did not identify any critical risks in any of the areas evaluated, and which included: energy, water, waste, emissions, spillages, raw materials and industrial security.
92% of employees in Spain work at locations certified under the ISO 14001 environmental standard In 2022, Indra took advantage of World and International Days celebrating the environment, water, oceans, recycling and biodiversity to raise awareness among its employees in the main countries where it maintains a presence.
14 In terms of atmospheric pollution, including noise and light pollution, Indra defines and carries out the relevant regular controls on the sources of atmospheric emissions at all its facilities, in compliance with current regulations.
Given the company s activity, none of the sources defined have been significant, either by type or operational hours.
The noise levels have also been measured by the Authorised Monitoring Bodies, which have determined that the noise levels outside the certified facilities are below the legal limits.
Given the activity of the company, the impact of light pollution is not considered to be significant.
Use of materials [GRI 416-1] In 2022 Indra finalised the improvement and automation project aimed at complying with the REACH Regulation regarding the use of dangerous and toxic chemicals.
As such, internal tools have been implemented that allow project managers to trace the presence of banned substances in the products and components manufactured by Indra via alerts that are generated when any such substance is present.
13 The main facilities are those in which production activities are carried out or where there is capacity for more than 500 employees.

Sustainability Report 2022 47 Sustainability Report 2022 6 People and talent [GRI 2-7] [GRI 2-8] Indra s talent management strategy is split into five core areas: attracting talent, empowerment, commitment, care and dialogue, all of which fall under one overarching principle: diversity.
Equal opportunities, respect and non-discrimination are key to Indra s culture 6.1 Diversity Indra's diversity strategy [GRI 405-1] Diversity is key to Indra s culture, and an element that defines the company s talent management framework.
Equal opportunities, diversity, respect and non-discrimination are fundamental principles present throughout all aspects of the professional career of anyone who forms part of Indra: in attracting the best talent, in professional development, in acknowledging the effort of employees, in issues relating to well-being and in terms of how people relate with the world around them.
The five dimensions of diversity at Indra Key metrics and initiatives in 2022 Functional diversity   Graduates of more than 100 university degrees Cultural   More than 300 technical Generational diversity skills diversity   Adding Skills Campaign   More than 140 nationalities   27% employees under 30   Cultural Diversity Week and 16% over 50 years old   Smart Start and Mentoring programmes Sex-affective Gender diversity diversity   Adherence to UN Standards   33% women in the of Conduct to combat workforce LGTBI discrimination   26% women in the   Diversity Club for the management team LGTBI+ community   Equality plans and sexual harassment protocols in Spain Sustainability Report 2022 48 Sustainability Report 2022 All Indra companies are covered by the same Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance, which rejects all forms of harassment and discrimination.
All Indra employee relations are governed by the principles of equal opportunity, diversity and respect for others, and no form of discrimination is tolerated, whether on the grounds of race, sex, religion, disability, sexual orientation, origin, economic position, birth, union membership, or any other personal or social condition or circumstance.
The company s gender protocols are intended to ensure working conditions free of sexual or gender harassment and set out specific procedures to enable complaints and claims.
In Spain, Equality Plans, the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance and gender diversity initiatives are Indra's main tools for ensuring that its employees are valued for their skills, effort and talent, regardless of their race, gender, religion, political beliefs, nationality, age, sexual orientation, civil status, disabilities, social origin or any other condition.
In 2022, Indra reached an agreement with unions on new Equality Plans, which include its protocols on sexual and gender-based harassment in Spain.
15 Among the most significant measures to be introduced are those relating to the work-life balance.
In Mexico, in addition to the commitments to diversity and respect for others set out in its relevant policies, in 2022 Indra also put such ideas into practice through the Hack Day initiative, aimed at encouraging female talent in STEM.
In Peru, the company has a Policy for the Prevention and Disciplining of Sexual Harassment, as well as protocols to tackle sexual harassment in the workplace.
Two main projects ran in 2022: the agreement on  Enterprise and Employability with Women in Metropolitan Lima  (Emprendimiento y Empleabilidad con Mujeres de Lima Metropolitana), in collaboration with the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in Peru and the NGO Cesal; and the "Networking Women" (Mujeres en Red) project, a joint initiative with Telef nica aimed at increasing female representation in the telecommunications sector as a way of reducing the gender gap.
In Italy, the company has set up a committee to promote gender equality in the country, where more than 700 women are currently employed.
In the latest survey of its workforce in Italy, 93.8% said that the corporate culture encourages diversity.
As part of its commitment to generational diversity, Indra has introduced programmes in Spain (Top Senior and Indra Digital Voices) and Brazil (Programa 40+) aimed at supporting senior talent.
These programmes draw on the expertise offered by Indra s employees, ensure that their legacy is passed on to the new generations and enhance their training with digital natives from within the company.
Acknowledgements for good practices in diversity In 2022, Indra was listed for a third consecutive year on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, thanks to its commitment to equality, diversity, the advancement of women and transparency in reporting on gender-related issues.
The company ranked particularly well on disclosure of its policies, achieving 98.51%, well above the average of 94%.
Indra has also held the Spanish government's Equality in the Company Distinction since 2011 and adheres to the Diversity Charter of the Diversity Foundation.
In 2022, Indra won the Inside Company category of the 2022 Generations awards in recognition of its management of generational diversity through the Top Senior programme.
It was also awarded the bronze medal in the Achievement in Coaching and Mentoring category at the Stevie Awards for its Digital Voices programme, which promotes reverse mentoring, where young people mentor their older colleagues in how to use social networks in order to build their online personal brand.
Indra Peru was recognised for being one of a small group of companies to have already measured its performance using ELSA   a comprehensive diagnostic and intervention tool that helps companies respond proactively to sexual harassment in the workplace   on two occasions.

Measures adopted in 2022 have included:   Symbolic action, in the form of events, to connect with internal and external talent which create a different impact and experience of employment.
These have included an internal event attended by 300 people; a job fair with 799 people registered, 70% of them target profiles; and celebrations of World Days related to ETF (Ada Lovelace Day, Systems Engineer Day, Future Day, IT Day, etc.
).
Highlighting the value of Indra's experts by helping them with their online positioning and ensuring that they participate and feature in all initiatives (podcasts, videos, events, etc.
).
Helping bring more young people and people at risk of exclusion into the technology sector in Colombia through the  Young Professionals  (J venes Profesionales) and  Indra Seedbed  (Semillero Indra) programmes, as part of which the company has created new vacancies to increase the availability of quality and qualified local employment.
According to Merco Talento, Indra is the consultancy company with the greatest capacity to attract and retain talent in Spain In Spain, Indra came first in the 2022 ranking compiled by the reputation monitor Merco Talento as the consultancy company with the greatest capacity to attract and retain talent.
This index evaluates the level of employee satisfaction, as well as the perception held by stakeholders of how talent is managed by the company.
Sourcing and developing young talent [GRI 401-1] In Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile and the Philippines, Indra s strategy is focused on sourcing young talent through the development of STEM vocations (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the communities where it operates, by participating in employment fairs and events, the Smart Start programme and by working with universities, business schools and professional training centres.
Among the initiatives aimed at improving the onboarding of new employees, increasing their motivation and maximising their contribution to the company, highlights include:   The integrated management of employee careers in their first two years in the company (Smart Start): this includes training, development, assessment and professional progress.
In response to post-pandemic restrictions, Indra developed tools to facilitate inter-professional networking and to help employees create a stronger connection between each other and the company.
Thanks to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, in 2022 the company began encouraging a return to more in-person initiatives.
In 2022, work also began on developing the Jumping Program, a new programme aimed at new hires and those who have completed Smart Start, offering a well-defined career development plan, more feedback, and performance-based promotion and remuneration.
A new process to improve the onboarding experience for all employees (both young and more senior): between 2019 and 2021, Indra updated its entire onboarding process, bringing it fully into line with the digital environment.
This process was complemented in 2022 by more in-person arrangements following the end of Covid-19.
Sustainability Report 2022 50 Sustainability Report 2022   Talent Camps for new employees to fast track their development in areas which are key for the company, such as Analytics, Digital Solutions and Financial Services, Air Traffic Management, Transport and Software Production Development.
More than 50% of the new recruits in 2022 were employees below the age of 30 Collaboration with the education sector In 2022, Indra in Spain created the Engineering + Technology Campus, a joint initiative in cooperation with universities (such as the University of Alcal  and the Polytechnic University of Madrid) and specialist consulting firms aimed at fast tracking the development of those with highly specialised tech profiles, such STEM talent being rare and therefore much in demand and fiercely fought over on the job market.
The campus will benefit from the unrivalled expertise of the company's authorities on areas such as radar, electronic defence, and digital communication and technology, used to further the continuous professional development not just of Indra employees, but also students, candidates and clients.
This commitment to education also includes other training initiatives that seek to attract young talent:   At a unique digital event, held via the online platforms Twitch and Youtube, Indra brought together more than 700 young engineers to familiarise them with the latest disruptive technologies and pioneering projects in transport and defence.
The event also saw professionals offer them an insight into careers at Indra and the company's culture of innovation, learning, impact and diversity.
The Connect and Programme your Development workshops as part of the IT job orientation programme aimed at students at the Instituto Comercial de Linares (Chile) benefit more than 200 students specialising in Programming and Connectivity and Networks at this school, which forms part of the Bicentenary Schools network.
The objective of this programme is to address the lack of professionals in this area, an area which will be key to Chile s digital transformation.
Indra offers students and graduates of Madrid s Universidad Carlos III opportunities for continuous training and challenges on unique engineering technology projects, alongside some of the world's leading experts in solutions for the aerospace, defence and transport sectors.
Inclusion of employees with disabilities In Spain, Italy, Brazil, Chile, and the Philippines Indra has specific measures in place to favour the integration of people with disabilities into the company.
In Spain and Chile, for example, Indra has put in place an Inclusion Policy.
This policy sets out the company s commitment to promoting the right to equal opportunities for people with disabilities, the aim of which is to ensure their inclusion in the workplace, this being instrumental in the full enjoyment of their rights and the elimination of any form of discrimination.
It also covers benefits for workers with disabilities and their families.
In Spain, for example, the company offers a parking space or ADSL line when the employee has mobility problems.
In addition, the company provides a counselling and support service to assist in the search for employment for both its employees with disabilities and members of their families with disabilities.
In Spain, 95% of the space at Indra s workplaces   in terms of area occupied16   is accessible to people with reduced mobility, meaning it complies with the majority of recommendations set out in the Spanish Building Code for Universal Accessibility17.
An evaluation of workplace accessibility is also underway at the international level, and this process is expected to be completed in 2023.
Most of the company s larger workplaces are accessible for staff with reduced mobility.
In order to increase its percentage of accessible workplaces, current and future refurbishments and renovations will, wherever possible, include the adoption of measures that ensure access for people with reduced mobility.
In Italy, the company is working on agreements with suppliers specialising in recruitment in order to meet its objectives of providing more opportunities to people with disabilities.
In the Philippines, differently abled professionals are hired based on their ability to perform the duties of a given role.
Similarly, they are included and taken into account when devising local programmes.

28% The flexible and multisource assessment model enables employee performance to be continually tracked and the evaluation to be tailored to each business.
Within its objectives, the assessment model aims to promote the values of collaboration, empowerment and innovation; to increase agility in team management; and to contribute to employee learning and professional fulfilment:   Performance Talent: Annual review conducted by line managers of employee performance and progress as this relates to that individual s career development plan and position in order to identify the next steps needed for their professional growth.
Performance Project: this provides the employee with more immediate and user-friendly feedback from their project lead.
Performance Goals: measures the degree to which the management team s targets have been met, with these being the employees who have the greatest impact on the company s financial, strategic and commercial results.
360  Feedback: an employee s managers, co-workers and peers provide feedback on their professional development.
This is designed for employees who have been at the company enough time for this solution to offer meaningful results.
Young Talent: Younger workers taking part in the Smart Start programme benefit from half-yearly evaluations from the moment they join the company right through to when they complete the programme.
89% of employees have the opportunity to take part in multi-dimensional assessments, which offer an opportunity for various evaluators to provide an all-round, objective view of the employee s performance.
These multidimensional evaluations are associated with different company processes (e.g. project-based evaluations, annual review), as well as different stages in a professional s career (e.g. first two years at the company, progression to management roles); this ensures that their performance is continuously monitored, helping them to get the most out of their development.
In 2022 Indra launched the Alto Potencial programme, with Feedback 360  now forming part of this.
Thanks to this new tool, in Colombia for instance, all Indra employees are able to find out proactively and in real time what the people they work with every day think about them, providing them with value-added input that can have a real impact on their professional development and career.
A work environment that encourages lifelong learning [GRI 404-1] Indra has a Lifelong Learning model, offering all employees the opportunity to engage in continued training where, how and whenever they want.
Total hours of training per year The aim of the training strategy is for training to be tailored to the needs of +1 million each employee, depending on the business they work in and in which phase of their career they find themselves.

The Lifelong Learning model has allowed Indra to adapt to new trends in learning, facilitated the process of updating professionals on new developments in its line of business, and was able to continue during a period in which employees were working remotely from a range of different physical locations.
Sustainability Report 2022 52 Sustainability Report 2022 In addition to this, some countries, such as the Philippines and Colombia, complement this model with classroom- based learning or specialist certification training.
A further example comes from Brazil, where training also takes the form of workshops on career management, internal mobility and current trends such as the metaverse.
Additionally, Indra has a technical training campus which provides training corresponding to the company s desired candidate profiles: Key People for Project, Key People for Product, the Engaging Leaders programme, Lead Your Growth, and so on.

Personnel Managers also have an online community page where they share learning and information.
In Spain, the special training programmes are designed in collaboration with the most prestigious business schools, to help Indra s technicians, managers and directors successfully assume new roles.
Although the majority of these programmes were devised under the blended learning methodology   which combines online and onsite training   the pandemic led Indra to adopt a 100% e-learning model, offering classes via streaming, webinars, microlearning, immersive and gamified experiences and online training modules with task delivery and personalised tutoring.
In fact, students must present their Masters and post-graduate projects virtually.
Continuing with its philosophy of continual improvement, in 2022 Indra launched three courses globally (Security, Ethics and Competition, and Secure Software Development) aimed at all personnel.
In 2021, Indra launched a global sustainability training plan which combines specific sessions and open online content for all employees.
The company continued to roll out the plan throughout the course of 2022:   Online sustainability course: compulsory for new staff and voluntary for all other employees.
The course aims to present basic sustainability concepts, as well as outlining how the company responds to ESG challenges via its 2020-2023 Sustainability Master Plan.
67% of the group s workforce completed this course in 2022.
Sustainability master class on the Growing Together and New Director programme: specific sessions on sustainability and strategy have been included in the content aimed at technicians, managers and directors.
Open content at Indra's Open University: five courses and more than ten topic-based videos available to all employees on key areas of sustainability, including Climate Change, circular economy, sustainable finance, Human Rights, diversity and inclusion, sustainable design and supply chain.
Special training plan for main soft skills, taught on Udemy.
Sustainability Report 2022 53 Sustainability Report 2022 Importance of professional growth The company gained further international recognition for its talent management in 2022, with the 2022 LinkedIn Top Companies ranking for Spain placing Indra in the number two spot for a second consecutive year.
The opportunities that Indra offers its employees to grow professionally and acquire new skills, the quality of its company culture and the connection that it creates with employees, as well as its stability, gender diversity and variety of educational backgrounds were some of the aspects that were most-valued by LinkedIn.
According to Spanish university students, Indra is the best company in its sector for professional development.
Indra came in first in the consulting category of the Merco Talento Universitario Espa a rankings for 2021/2022.

Analysis of employee priorities and adaptation of value proposition Indra has used a science-based approach to assess how committed its employees are and identify the motivations that drive them.
In order to analyse and identify patterns the results obtained, the company has classified its employees into clusters, grouping them according to variables such as age, length of time at the company, professional status and salary level.
People Analytics: Intelligence applied to people management The development of information systems and the greater availability of data have brought about a paradigm shift in people management: applying a data-based approach to talent management.
Indra, as a technology company with a business model founded on talent, is committed to applying People Analytics in the management of its employees.
Its goal is to understand people's behaviour at an analytical level in order to develop a much more analytical talent management model that improves the experience for talent while making the process more rigorous and allowing more follow-up.
More specifically, Indra is developing the following projects related directly to People Analytics:   Single global scorecard, generated automatically in Power BI, with critical indicators for talent management.
Available to the Talent team and the business and used as a key tool for identifying areas for action/improvement which can then be followed up: professional development, wage bill per employee, employee turnover, new hires, unfulfilled needs.
Monthly monitoring using the scorecard of critical talent management indicators, allowing swift action to be taken on the implementation of corrective measures.
These measures, for example, the absorption of wage bill increases through pyramid management (mainly "juniorisation" and offshoring); changes in the average cost, by position, of filling vacancies created by unwanted staff turnover, and the gap existing with respect to the current workforce (can be used to measure changes in the degree of wage inflation for certain positions and technological profiles of personnel); proportion of undesired turnover, by business segment and profile type, and how this compares to the rest of the sector; and new hires per month, by field and recruiter.
Identifying skills gaps, and professional development and retraining: People Analytics and a process known as  association rule learning  are used to identify areas of knowledge that employees could benefit from that are more in line with employees  current skill sets.
This allows Indra to improve the process of assigning people with certain profiles to particular projects and helps identify opportunities for retraining staff in related technologies that are in higher demand.
Use of data analysis to establish talent objectives for each business unit.
These objectives concern optimisation of the pyramid structure as a way of keeping increases in the wage bill per employee in check.
This involves using historical and market ratios to help determine hiring requirements for junior Sustainability Report 2022 54 Sustainability Report 2022 staff in order to improve the wage bill, based on turnover statistics for this group, past promotion ratios, and desired growth and targets for juniorisation ratios.
All the initiatives in terms of People Analytics comply with current data protection legislation (GDPR) and respect the privacy rights of the company s employees.
Assessing levels of commitment In 2022, the commitment survey was conducted in Spain, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
According to the survey, and based on the sample consulted, 78.7% of Indra employees were found to have a high level of commitment, with no significant differences between genders.
The breakdown of results by gender, geographical area, age group and professional category can be found in Appendix 11.6.
Indra employees had a commitment of 78.7% according to the survey conducted in 2022 Indra set up the Feedback Office in 2021   an assessment tool that allows it to carry out multi-language global-level surveys and receive regular employee feedback on key issues for the company.
Remuneration adjusted to employee needs and focused on the short, medium and long term [GRI 401-2] Indra s objective is to offer remuneration adapted to the diversity of its talent.
The results of the performance assessments have an impact on its employees  career decisions and their remuneration.
Indra s remuneration package comprises a fixed salary, part of which can be paid into each employee s flexible remuneration plan; social benefits, which can vary between the different Group companies; and a system of variable remuneration payable to 19% of employees, which aims to encourage achievement of the objectives set out in the Performance Experience model.
Examples of non-monetary remuneration at Indra Well-being Lifeinsurance programme Privilege Store, Family Work-lifebalance discountsfor Programme measures employees In Spain, the company offers a flexible remuneration plan via which all employees can allocate part of their salary towards healthcare, transport, nursery vouchers, pension plans, training and restaurant vouchers, allowing them to benefit from discounted prices and tax relief.
In 2022, 39% of the workforce in Spain benefitted from the plan.
In other geographies, social benefits vary depending on the company (e.g. insurance, restaurant vouchers and company cars).
To ensure the sustainability of the business, 28% of managers have medium- and long-term targets that are tied to the company s strategic objectives being achieved.
In the IT business, 40% of the total variable remuneration paid to managers is tied to qualitative objectives, while this percentage is 20% in T&D.
Ten percent of the medium-term variable remuneration paid to senior management and other directors is tied to ESG targets.
Sustainability Report 2022 55 Sustainability Report 2022 The variable remuneration of senior management is tied to sustainability objectives The yearly targets for executive directors are published every year, as are the percentage of these targets reached at the end of the financial year in the Annual Report on Director Remuneration.
Wage gap [GRI 405-2] In order to improve its management of diversity, Indra distinguishes between two kinds of indicators when assessing differences in salaries between genders.
This makes it easier for the company to identify the reasons explaining these differences and define suitable improvement plans.
These indicators are wage inequality and wage gap.
The wage gap indicator includes all the relevant variables that could affect a person s salary and represents a more realistic measure of differences in salary for the same position.
This difference, illustrated in the table below, is partly explained by the historical structure of the company and the fact that women have been working at the company for less time, among other factors.

The wage gap is calculated by comparing the remuneration between segments of equivalent employees (same category, same business unit, same region/country).
In other words, the figure obtained represents the percentage that women earn less than men, considering similar positions and responsibilities.
The calculation does not include professional segments that do not contain at least one female and one male employee, meaning that it actually extends to 90% of the workforce.
Wage inequality is calculated as the difference in salary (average male employees   average female salary) / (average male salary), without taking into consideration any other factor that could have an influence on a person s remuneration, such as geographical location or the department where they work.
This calculation considers the fixed salary and variable amount paid.
Additional concepts such as: cash grants, bonuses, long-term incentives, share-based remuneration etc.
are not included.
For more indicators relating to remuneration by gender and age, see the section headed  Other non-financial indicators .
Includes data on 97% of the total workforce at year-end.
(**) NB: in 2022, figures for the wage gap and wage inequality at management level widened due to the exit from the company of Minsait s CEO in 2022, which in the case of the wage gap was compared to other members of the Steering Committee.
If the CEO had not left the company, the 2022 wage gap and wage inequality figures at the management level would have been 7.8% and 15% respectively.
(***) NB: in 2022, wage inequality in  other categories  is a result of both the type of professionals joining the company (e.g. 194 new employees at Teknatrans Consultores) and large-scale hirings in businesses such as BPO (e.g. 413 people hired at Indra Colombia and 225 at Indra BPO M xico)   where there is a certain time lag between joining the company and taking on roles.
Within these groups (especially in the case of recent acquisitions), wages are all very much on a par with each other.
The wage gap stood at 1.92% in Spain in 2022 There is no gender bias in the remuneration policy implemented by Indra.
The two key components of the company remuneration structure (fixed monetary remuneration and variable annual remuneration) are set objectively.
Fixed remuneration primarily reflects the employee s experience and their level of responsibility within the organisation, while the variable remuneration rewards the achievement of targets that are fundamentally quantitative and shared amongst the employees that work in the same departments.
Sustainability Report 2022 56 Sustainability Report 2022 Indra works to adopt the most appropriate measures to eliminate this gap.
The following measures are particularly worthy of mention:   The gender diversity strategy: this comprises four lines of action, promoting technological vocations among women, incorporating gender mainstreaming into all talent management processes, ensuring an inclusive culture, and championing female talent in key roles.
The development of work-life balance policies: in addition to facilitating a balance between employees  personal and professional lives, these policies promote joint parental responsibility by offering the same measures to both men and women; for example, improved maternity and paternity leave following the birth of a child, the possibility of accompanying children and parents to medical appointments, etc.
Training and awareness: in 2022, Indra continued to offer several training programmes aimed at raising awareness of various aspects of diversity, such as leadership, management of diverse labour environments, the prevention of sexual and gender harassment and unconscious bias.
In Spain, the Equality Plans of the main companies are negotiated with the majority of union representatives.
In Colombia, the hiring of women is favoured in the interests of equal conditions and with a view to increasing female presence in the tech sector.
Top Employer Institute recognised Indra as offering one of the best workplace environments and for its capacity to incorporate innovation into talent management Improved ratings in external certifications, rankings and awards systems Indra has tools, rankings and awards systems in place that allow it to monitor the perceptions of its employees regarding its performance: In 2022, Indra was ranked the best Ibex-35 company to work at in Spain for a second consecutive year.
The company is the top listed company and the second in Spain according to the  LinkedIn top Companies 2022  which identifies the companies that best drive long-term professional success.
Indra is also listed in the  100 best places to work in Spain  ranking compiled by Actualidad Econ mica and was certified as a Great Place to Work in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Brazil in 2022 in recognition of how the company treats its employees, its ethics and its international leadership.
In 2022, Indra and Minsait both renewed the certification awarded by Top Employers Institute to companies that offer the best work environments, obtaining the highest score possible in workplace environment, ethics and values and improving its score significantly in aspects related to its appeal.
At the seventh edition of its Health and Innovation Awards, Mutua Universal   an insurance company that works in close collaboration with Spain s Social Security   recognised Indra in the Institutional Award category for its ambitious employee well-being programme.
6.5 Health, safety and well-being Indra has a strategic commitment to ensure the highest possible level of health, safety and well-being of its employees, regardless of their business division, geographical location or activity.
This commitment is reflected in the Occupational Risk Prevention Policy, the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance and in the Sustainability Policy, which also apply to the company s suppliers and subcontractors, who also accept the conditions set out in the aforementioned Code of Ethics and the Supplier Sustainability Policy.
For more information, see section 7.8.
In Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile and the Philippines, Indra has an annual health and safety training programme in place.
All Indra s employees must complete compulsory training on the prevention of occupational risks, with the content varying slightly for different positions.
Due to the nature of certain positions within the company, the training programme may include courses on specific matters such as risks at height or in confined spaces.
In general terms, none of Indra s employees are authorised to carry out their roles without having completed the required training and without wearing the required PPE.
In Spain, the course on emergency measures was further developed and enhanced in 2022, given that remote working models have affected how emergency teams work and organise themselves.
By offering this course, the level of training received by all of Indra s employees is now on a par with that received by emergency teams and as such the company can act appropriately in the event of an incident at any of its sites.
Another example is the Philippines where the first-aid and OHS training given to all employees particularly stands out, or Italy where first-aid training was also enhanced in 2022.
Sustainability Report 2022 57 Sustainability Report 2022 Health and safety governance model [GRI 403-1] [GRI 403-2] [GRI 403-3] [GRI 403-4] [GRI 403-7] [GRI 403-8] [GRI 403-9] [GRI 403-10] As established by the Board of Directors Regulations, the Board is ultimately responsible for the supervision of the organisation s financial and non-financial risk management, the latter supported by the Sustainability Committee and the Auditing and Compliance Committee.
Inasmuch as health and safety risks are part of the company s non-financial risks, they also come under the supervision of the Board of Directors.
The ISO 45001 standard is the benchmark certification used to accredit Indra s health and safety management systems Indra holds ISO 45001 certification for the health and safety management systems in its main companies in Spain and in the group s subsidiaries in Italy, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Australia.
65% of Indra s employees are covered by a certified health and safety management system.
In all cases, the health and safety management systems guarantee the identification of the risks, the implementation of preventative measures and the traceability of related processes (investigation of accidents and continual improvement, among others).
This determines the preventative measures which the company should adopt, primarily in terms of personal protective equipment (PPE), medical fitness for work and training.
In 2022, one occupational illness was identified at Indra (endemic in a country which the Indra employee had travelled to).
Nonetheless, according to the current legislation in Spain and as reflected in Indra s internal regulations, the company s employees have the right and the duty to report risk situations in the workplace, and where applicable, stop working.
In 2022, 129 work accidents were registered, with and without medical leave, excluding injuries occurring during the commute to or from work.
In terms of geography, 83 of the accidents occurred in Spain, 3 in the rest of Europe, 39 in Latin America and 4 in EMEA.
All the indicators are available in Appendix 11.6 of this report.
During 2022, Indra also identified 3 occupational incidents in Spain, none of which resulted in physical harm to the individuals (only involving material damage).
Indra investigated the causes; identified the possible consequences under different circumstances; and identified and implemented corrective action, such as replacing certain equipment or raising awareness among the workforce.
Over the past two years, Indra has steadily reduced the number of work accidents registered.
This can largely be explained by the fact that, traditionally, a considerable number of these accidents were those incurred by employees during the commute to or from work.
With the Covid-19 pandemic fuelling models based around remote working, employees are commuting to and from work less and as a result the number of accidents has fallen.
Indra has 148 prevention delegates in Spain, who act on behalf of its staff.
In the other countries, and where it is required by local legislation, the workforce is represented by the equivalent of the prevention delegates, as contemplated in the legislation of that country.
In 2022 there were no relevant formal agreements with unions on these matters.
Spain, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru have an Occupational Risk Management Prevention System Handbook.
In Spain, both the manual and the procedure for evaluating risks and planning preventative action are available to all employees on the company s intranet.
Meanwhile, all members of the supply chain can refer to the Manual for the coordination of business activities regarding the prevention of occupational risks to see the company s health and safety principles.
In the Philippines, Indra complies with regulatory requirements regarding health and safety in the workplace, such as:   Carrying out medical check-ups on new employees and every year on all employees.
Ensuring that there are survival kits in offices.
Carrying out routine earthquake and fire drills.
Sustainability Report 2022 58 Sustainability Report 2022 Introducing more flexible work practices [GRI 401-3] [GRI 403-6] The company continually assesses and reviews the policies which determine the working conditions of its employees across all the geographies where it operates.
Indra has had work-life balance measures in place since 2005, which differ in each of the countries where the company operates.
In line with its work-life balance and flexible working policies, Indra also respects its employees  right to disconnect from work outside working hours and makes it its goal to comply with the regulatory obligations in terms of internal policies in the various countries where it operates.
In Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile and the Philippines for example, the company has specific WFH policies which set out a framework for digital disconnection and flexible working hours.
These work-life balance measures are intended to offer a response at different key moments in an employee s working life, such as when they become parents, have to care for family members, or in specific situations such as incidents involving gender-based violence, or when an employee wants to pursue personal goals relating to volunteering or training.
In Colombia, there are private spaces for breastfeeding mothers to express milk, while in Spain employees can take extended leave for volunteering work, and request days off to take exams or hours off to accompany a family member or person under their care to a medical appointment.
The company also has agreements in place with nearby childcare facilities.
In the majority of Indra Group companies in Spain, all measures that apply are set out in its Equality Plans18 that go above and beyond the legal requirements, offering maternity and paternity leave that is longer than legally required, along with improvements in terms of the categories of paid leave.
Amongst the company s most notable flexibility measures is its flexitime policy, which is available in the majority of its businesses and allows its employees to enjoy a better work-life balance.
Every year work schedules are drawn up.
These ensure that no employee exceeds the number of days that should be worked, while in Spain they also establish the theoretical daily working hours in the daily registration tool available to employees and workers  legal representatives.
The daily registration tool meets the requirements of Law 8/2019.
In line with its work-life balance and flexible working policies, Indra also respects its employees  right to disconnect from work outside working hours and makes it its goal to comply with the obligations of the Spanish regulations regarding internal policies.
The Equality Plans signed in Spain in 2022 underline the company s commitment to flexible work practices and occupational well-being The Equality Plans signed in the companies located in Spain in 2022 underline the company s commitment to flexible work practices and occupational well-being.
These plans contain work-life balance measures designed to ensure employees are able to engage in their work and develop their capabilities in a working environment that compliments their both personal well-being and development.
These measures fulfil both individual and business needs, in a global world in which work is not something rigid, but rather something that we are increasingly able to adapt in terms of the when and the where and in terms of making time for people s health and relationships   all while optimising results in the process.
18 List of companies with Equality Plans in place in Spain: Indra Sistemas, Indra Corporate Services, Indra Factor a Tecnol gica (IFT), ALG Global Infrastructure Advisors, Prointec, Indra Soluciones Tecnolog as de la Tnformaci n (ISTI), Indra Holding Tecnolog as de la Informaci n, Indra producci n software, Indra BPO Servicios, Indra BPO, Minsait Payment Systems, Indra Business Consulting (IBC), Sistemas Inform ticos Abiertos (SIA), Paradigma and Flat 101 (pending negotiation with unions).
Sustainability Report 2022 59 Sustainability Report 2022 Below, we highlight some of the measures to promote flexible working and occupational well-being that are currently in place across the company s main geographies:   In Spain, flexibility in terms of working hours19, offering employees flexibility in terms of the times they start/finish work and take their lunch breaks; WFH policy in place for positions in which 40-80% of the required work can be completed remotely.
Employees who are pregnant will also be able to work from home as of their twenty-fourth week of pregnancy; flexibility for employees with dependent family members; reduced working hours from Monday to Thursday; parental support   childcare vouchers as part of flexible payments, parking for pregnant women, in addition to Social Security maternity and paternity payments, payments of up to 100% of normal salary applicable as of the first day of leave; nursing leave over and above the minimum required by law until the baby is nine months, with parents able to choose who will take the leave and how it will be split; paid maternity or paternity leave, in addition to the legal minimum requirement, Indra offers paid leave to anyone returning from maternity or paternity leave after the birth or adoption of a child.
The beneficiary can take this leave in the way that best suits their needs: either by (i) extending their parental leave by 15 calendar days20, or (ii) halving their working day while still on a full salary for the first 30 calendar days21 upon their return to work.
In Italy, as well as measures taken to offer reduced working days and parental support, the following measures designed to enhance the work-life balance and introduce more flexible work practices are particularly noteworthy; all employees are included in the flexible WFH policy; there are flexible start and finish times, and the flexible working policy also recognises staff s right to digitally disconnect.
In Colombia the measures taken to enhance the work-life balance and introduce more flexible work practices promote quality employment, spatial and temporal flexibility and offer advantages for the employee and his or her family.
Indra has also established a series of strategic work-life balance measures that help it to both fulfil its commitment to favour the country s development and help increase its birth rate.
For example, it has rolled out initiatives to help working mothers, introducing private rooms for expressing milk and promoting flexible start and finish times.
This policy recognises the right to digitally disconnect.
In Peru, there is both a summer working hours policy and a flexible working hours policy which allows each project manager to agree flexible working days with their teams, adapting the start and finish times to suit.
In Chile, matters relating to flexible working and work-life balance are set out in the Internal Code of Conduct, Health and Safety.
The Philippines has agreements for flexible work practices in place that allow employees to work remotely via a hybrid model, offer benefits to both pregnant employees and male employees whose partners are pregnant, as well as to single-parent families.
Occupational well-being [GRI 403-6] Beyond the strict compliance with its legal obligations in all the geographies where Indra operates, the company also promotes employee well-being and a culture of prevention across all its operations.
Similarly, across all the regions where it operates, Indra looks to offer training, raise awareness and inform its employees about the basic prerequisites in terms of workplace health and safety that are essential for promoting a culture of prevention.
Indra is committed to fulfilling its obligations in this matter and achieving continual improvement.
In Spain, the Joint Prevention Service (SPM in its Spanish acronym) is a key tool that provides coverage to more than 29,000 employees in the field of Health, Safety, Ergonomics and Counselling.
This service allows all of Indra s employees to conduct their work safely, regardless of their job or location.
19 This applies to Indra Sistemas, Indra Corporate Services, Indra Factor a de Software, Prointec, Indra Soluciones Tecnolog as de la Informaci n (ISTI), Indra Producci n de Software (IPS), Minsait Payment Systems, Indra Holding Tecnolog as de la Informaci n, Sistemas Inform ticos Abiertos (SIA) and Indra Gesti n de Usuarios.
It does not apply to Indra Business Consulting, Indra BPO, Indra BPO Servicios and ALG Global Infrastructure Advisors.

Sustainability Report 2022 60 Sustainability Report 2022 Well-being programme [GRI 403-5] In November 2020, the company s global well-being programme was restructured around three main pillars   physical, emotional and financial well-being   that make employees the primary focus.
This new approach has allowed the company to devise a far-reaching and diverse programme that is tailored to all of Indra s employees, involves the company s various geographical and business areas and takes account of its rich generational, gender, functional, cultural and sexual and affective diversity.
Indra actively works to raise awareness among its employees of the need to avoid risks and lead healthy lifestyles Each month, the well-being programme offers activities related to physical, emotional and/or financial well-being which is open to employees.
Indra also offers free services such as an online gym, an app-based medical service or a variety of well-being apps that allow every employee to work on any aspect of their health that they wish to focus on or improve.
In this regard, in 2022, the company rolled out an exclusive new telemedicine service for employees, offering remote video consults for general health, nutrition and diet, paediatrics and mental health, as well as the possibility of speaking to a personal trainer.
As far as financial well-being is concerned, each month Indra offers workshops and advice on tax returns, savings, paid leave, legal advice, mortgages, risk protection and personal finance planning.
It also provides a banking service for the exclusive use of employees which, among other benefits, pays back 50% of the profits that it generates to account holders.
In the interests of its employees  physical well-being, Indra also offers expert-led sessions on healthy eating, physical fitness, how to prevent and manage illness and how sport and rest can have a positive impact on people s health.
Mental health management [GRI 403-6] As part of its commitments to the emotional well-being of its employees, each month in Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and the Philippines Indra offers activities based on how to manage oneself and the people around you (children and people in your care).
By offering different sessions each month, the company trains its employees in ways to better manage stress, such as mindfulness exercises or applying strategic planning to personal development, as well as offering counselling services.
In Spain, Italy, Peru and the Philippines the company monitors employee health through its workplace risk appraisals, its well-being programme and especially through the initiatives designed to promote well-being and stress management.
Sustainability Report 2022 61 Sustainability Report 2022 6.6 Dialogue [GRI 2-30] [GRI 402-1] [GRI 407-1] Indra respects the culture of legality that exists in each of the countries in which it operates and complies with the regulatory content of the ILO collective bargaining agreements in relation to the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
It therefore interacts with workers  representatives in the company, providing them with a channel for dialogue and the adoption of agreements.
Indra applies the collective bargaining agreements in force at any time to ensure compliance with all the rights established in them as a consequence of collective bargaining, including those relative to pay scales, which are what determine the minimum wage for each category or group of employees.
As per the remuneration indicators in Appendix 11.6, the initial standard wage is always much higher than the local minimum wage in each country where Indra has significant operations.
The company is also a member of the Spanish Association of Consulting Companies (AEC in its Spanish acronym), which negotiates the social component of the Collective Bargaining Agreement applicable to all the companies in the sector.
Over the course of 2022, negotiations continued on the 18th Collective Agreement for Consultancy Businesses.
Indra is a member of the negotiation board, together with other leading consultancy and information technology companies, and the Agreement is expected to be signed and published by the first quarter of 2023.
Indra is also registered with the Asociaci n de Empresas del Metal de Madrid (Madrid Metal Businesses Association,  AECIM ), the governing board for the metal industry in the Region of Madrid, which is responsible for negotiating collective agreements for businesses working and trading in the metal sector in Madrid.
Indra also participates in the think-tank sponsored by the Cuatrecasas Institute of Legal Strategy in Human Resources, where leading national and international companies hold regular meetings to proactively seek innovative ways to regulate issues, discuss the changes in the regulatory framework and help authorities draft new legislation.
Furthermore, the 16th edition of Merco Talento saw Minsait climb up the ranking 12 places to become the leading consultancy company in terms of attracting and retaining talent in Spain in recognition of its capacity to create an optimal work environment for employees.
99.5% of employees are covered by instruments to safeguard their rights collectively 99.5% of Indra s employees have at their disposal the wherewithal to safeguard their rights collectively, either because their interests are defended by unions or worker representatives, or because they could be sheltered by collective bargaining agreements.
Of these employees, 75% are effectively covered by collective bargaining agreements.
The company Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance also establishes equal opportunities, respect for people and non- discrimination on any grounds and, specifically, on the grounds of union membership as basic principles.
As part of the active communication of Indra s Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance and its mandatory acceptance by all the company s employees, the company trains its workforce on the issues addressed by the Code and informs them that all employees are expected to participate in meeting the commitment to respect Human Rights listed in the International Charter on Human Rights, along with the principles governing the rights set out in the Declaration by the International Labour Organization, both of which contain specific references to the freedom of association.
Similarly, among the measures taken by the company to ensure strict respect for its rules of conduct and values, the Direct Channel is the main resource available to all employees to report and file a complaint in relation to any incidents occurring in this regard.
As described in section 4.1 of this report, in 2022 the Direct Channel did not receive any notifications or complaints from any of the company s employees in relation to their rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining.
It is important for Indra to maintain a continued and open dialogue with social agents, ensuring they participate in the company s guidelines and strategy.
In the event of significant changes in operations, the necessary mechanisms to inform the various trade union partners in advance have been put in place.
In 2022, the terms for transferring employees between places of work were agreed with trade union partners in order to guarantee the well-being of workers and protect their rights.
Furthermore, Indra Sistemas holds quarterly meetings with workers  representatives to facilitate dialogue on the issues that are most important to employees.
Sustainability Report 2022 62 Sustainability Report 2022 The impact that operational changes may have on employees is carefully evaluated, establishing an open dialogue with their union representatives.
Even in the event that there are no legal obligations or workers  representatives, Indra ensures that it maintains regular communication with all the employees concerned.
In Spain, the company has union representatives, who act as points of contact for the Group companies.
The company helps them carry out their labour union duties in all aspects, including the provision of resources such as computers and workspaces.
Agreements reached with workers  legal representatives in 2022 The Company s commitment to equality is set out in its Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance, as well as in its Diversity Policy and Equality Plans.
In 2022, Indra and the Workers  Legal Representatives in Spain jointly drew up the new Equality Plans for group companies in order to reinforce the principles of equal opportunities, diversity, personal respect and non-discrimination (on grounds of race, gender, sexual orientation, language, religion, disability, origin or any other personal or social condition or circumstance).
In addition, particular attention has been paid to the work-life balance in order to make Indra a better place to work.
The Equality Plans for Indra Systems, Paradigma and Prointec have been signed with a duration of four years, while at the remaining companies they will remain in force until 2023.
Other agreements reached with workers  legal representatives in 2022 In addition, aware of the way that the company was evolving, the technological developments seen in the area of communications and the need to find a balance between the right to reconcile professional, personal and family duties and the potential distortions that could be caused by permanent connectivity, Indra Soluciones Tecnolog as de la Informaci n and the Workers  Legal Representatives reached an agreement in Spain in relation to Digital Disconnection.
This agreement defines the way in which the right to disconnect can be exercised, along with training and awareness activities for staff relating to the reasonable use of technological tools in order to ensure respect for employee rest periods, leave and holidays, along with respect for their privacy and enjoyment of their personal lives and family relationships.
Agreements have also been reached in Argentina, Chile and Brazil to ensure that salaries reflect current inflation figures.

7.1 Analysis of application of the EU Taxonomy Regulatory background The EU Taxonomy is one of the measures implemented by the European Commission as part of its Action Plan for the financing of sustainable growth, which is aimed at directing capital flows towards more sustainable activities and advancing the achievement of the European Union s environmental and social targets.
The Taxonomy establishes a common language and a clear definition of which activities can be regarded as  sustainable .
The current version of the Taxonomy has only been developed in respect of environmental issues, defining the requirements that an economic activity must meet in order to be regarded as  sustainable  in relation to Climate Change adaptation and mitigation objectives.
For an activity to be regarded as  environmentally sustainable  under the Taxonomy, a distinction must be made between eligibility and alignment.
An activity is  eligible  if it is described in the relevant Delegated Regulation.
An eligible activity is regarded as  aligned  if it meets the technical screening criteria (which are specific to each activity and the Climate Change adaptation and mitigation objectives), it does not cause any significant harm to the other environmental objectives (protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, prevention and Sustainability Report 2022 64 Sustainability Report 2022 control of pollution and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems), and it furthermore meets the minimum social guarantees.
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of 10 December establishes the reporting requirements for companies with regard to sustainable activities under the Taxonomy.
From the first financial year that this regulation came into force (2021), companies were only required to disclose the percentage of their income, capex and opex that was linked to business activities regarded as eligible, i.e. activities that had the potential to make a substantial contribution to the Climate Change adaptation and mitigation objectives.
During the current financial year, it is also necessary to make a complete analysis of any activities aligned with the Taxonomy in accordance with the technical screening criteria.
In 2022, Indra carried out an analysis of the eligibility and alignment of its portfolio of activities in relation to the EU Taxonomy requirements Against this backdrop, during 2022 Indra made a detailed analysis of its portfolio of activities in relation to the Taxonomy requirements, along the same lines as the analysis carried out during the previous year, in which Indra anticipated the reporting obligations relating to the degree to which its activities were aligned.
The analysis first consisted of examining the levels of eligibility of the Company s products and services in relation to the sustainable activities defined in the Taxonomy, followed by an analysis of the degree to which these activities were aligned with the technical screening criteria defined in the Delegated Regulation and with the social safeguards.
As of March 2023, the Taxonomy has still not been fully developed, either in terms of climate-related issues or with regard to the rest of the environmental and social objectives.
Publication of the Delegated Regulation with the technical criteria for the environmental objectives remains pending, as does publication of the Social Taxonomy for the activities that contribute substantially to the social objectives.
The company is closely monitoring developments in the Taxonomy Regulation, and these are reported as and when required to the Sustainability Committee.
Scope of the analysis The analysis carried out to identify activities that were eligible under the Taxonomy criteria included the activities of Indra Sistemas and its dependent companies, i.e. all the companies in which Indra Sistemas has a holding of more than 50%.
Interpretation and application of the Taxonomy s regulatory framework at Indra According to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, non-financial companies must declare the proportion of their turnover, capex (investment in fixed assets) and opex (operating expenditure) that is eligible under the Taxonomy, together with any explanatory information that allows these three indicators to be properly interpreted.
To analyse the eligibility of Indra s activities according to the Taxonomy, the company started from the consolidated information contained in the Group s analytical accounting systems which, in accordance with its corporate criteria, classify income, capex and opex at a project level and group them together on the basis of the relevant corporate organisation level (division and business unit).
The characteristics of the data used as a starting point include the fact that they are consolidated at group level and thus do not give rise to any duplication of accounts, and they are coded at a single project level in terms of income, capex and opex, which enables the criteria used to classify these three indicators to be applied consistently.
Working from this analytical accounting information, an analysis was made of the activities engaged in by the company in order to determine whether the description of each activity corresponded to any of the activities listed in the Taxonomy.
Where there was any doubt, reference was made to the National Classification of Economic Activities (CNAE) code that the Regulation identifies for each type of activity.
What s more, in order to ensure consistency between the volumes of income, capex and opex reported on the basis of the analytical accounts and the information contained in the Annual Accounts, a cross-referenced review was carried out between both of these sources of information.
Sustainability Report 2022 65 Sustainability Report 2022 Accounting criteria used as a reference The proportion of eligible activities referred to in Article 8, section 2 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 has been calculated as  eligible activity  = A/B   Where in each case A is:   Business turnover; equals the proportion of net business turnover resulting from products or services associated with business activities included in the denominator - including intangibles - that meets the criteria for eligibility under the Taxonomy (see section 7.2)   Capex: equals the proportion of the investments in fixed assets included in the denominator - including additions to investments - that meets the criteria for eligibility under the Taxonomy (see section 7.2)   Opex: equals the proportion of operating costs included in the denominator that meets the criteria for eligibility under the Taxonomy (see section 7.2)   Where in each case B is the initial financial information, as defined below:   Business turnover: net business turnover as defined in Article 2, section 5 of Directive 2013/34/EU.
The turnover figure includes the income entered in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82, letter a), adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) 1126/2008.
Capex: includes the sum of the additions to investments set out in Note 6 ( Property, plant and equipment ) and Note 9 ( Other intangible assets ), of the notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts, under the headings  Computer software  and  Development costs .

Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to Climate Change adaptation (e.g. activity carried out by Prointec) The activities not deemed to be eligible are mainly the activities associated with the manufacture of technology linked to the Defence and Security business (e.g. FCAS, Eurofighter).
In 2022, the percentage eligibility figures for turnover (90%), capex (89%) and opex (90%) remained in line with the figures for 2021 (88%; 88% and 90% respectively).
7.3 Taxonomy-aligned activities Indra has analysed the alignment of its activities with regard to the Climate Change mitigation and adaptation objectives.
The general results of this Aligned turnover analysis, expressed in terms of turnover, investments (capex) and operating 18% expenditure (opex), in line with the criteria set out in the Delegated Regulations, give the levels of alignment shown in the attached table.
Aligned capex These percentages represent the proportion of Indra s solutions and 23% services that make a positive contribution to the two climate objectives currently provided for in the Taxonomy relating to Climate Change Aligned opex mitigation and adaptation.
This should not be interpreted as meaning that 16% Indra s remaining solutions and services are causing adverse impacts, but simply that, with regard to the climate objectives, they do not make a significantly positive impact.
In order to assess the degree to which activities are aligned with the technical criteria set out in the Delegated Regulation, Indra has analysed the solutions representing each group of eligible activities with the aim of confirming whether or not they are Taxonomy-aligned, i.e. whether they substantially contribute to a climate objective, do not cause significant harm to the other objectives and comply with the social safeguards.
At corporate level, thanks to Indra s Human Rights policy and compliance with the regulatory framework in place in the different countries in which it operates, the minimum requirements for social safeguards are met across all its activities.
A percentage of the solutions and technologies developed by Indra contribute substantially to achieving the Climate Change adaptation and mitigation objectives set out in the EU Taxonomy, meaning that they are Taxonomy-aligned.
These activities include solutions from both divisions.
Some examples of these solutions include: - Transport and Defence: air traffic management (ATM) systems that enable the optimisation of routes; operational support systems (OSS) which improve the efficiency of fleet management; safety systems on the rail network, intelligent free-flow toll systems that offer improvements for road traffic and the reduction of emissions; satellite communication systems that increase the ability of communications to withstand climate events; Earth monitoring tools that make it possible to obtain data to prevent climate-related risk, and simulators that prevent unnecessary emissions during training processes.
Sustainability Report 2022 67 Sustainability Report 2022 - Minsait: technologies for the digitalisation of processes and the migration of data to the cloud, thus providing a more secure and accessible infrastructure in the case of extreme climate events, projects to create intelligent and climate-neutral cities, the holding of online elections, solutions for monitoring energy generation systems, etc.
In 2022, eligible revenues totalled  3,447.6 million (90%), of which  686.2 million (18%) were classified as environmentally sustainable according to the Taxonomy.
These mainly corresponded to revenues resulting from technological solutions for the efficient management of air transport (ATM), rail transport, road transport, simulators, digitalisation and renewable energies.
The KPI relating to the eligibility of revenues for the 2021 financial year was 88%, in line with the percentage obtained in 2022.
With regard to eligible capex, the figure for 2022 totalled  48.4 million (89%), of which  12.7 million (23%) was classified as environmentally sustainable according to the Taxonomy.
The KPI relating to the eligibility of capex for the 2021 financial year was 88%, in line with the percentage obtained in 2022.
Finally, eligible opex in 2022 totalled  3,193.5 million (90%), of which  580.6 million (16%) was classified as environmentally sustainable according to the Taxonomy.
The eligibility percentage remained in line with the percentage obtained in 2021 (90%).
Fulfilment of technical screening criteria For each of the activities identified as eligible, the substantial contribution and  do no significant harm  technical criteria were assessed in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation.
The Indra Group s compliance with the minimum social safeguards was also verified.
The activities identified as eligible in accordance with Annex I of Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 have been matched with their corresponding EU Taxonomy definitions and meet both the technical screening criteria and the  do no significant harm  criteria that apply to these.
The following is a non-exhaustive account of how the main activities identified by Indra as being aligned with the Taxonomy Regulation s climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives meet these technical screening criteria.

Manufacturing 3.6 Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies Technical screening criteria: The economic activity manufactures technologies that are aimed at substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings.
iTEC ATM Automation Indra is the technology provider for the iTEC Alliance,22 the group tasked with building the Single European Sky.
The air traffic management (ATM) solutions that Indra develops for this alliance allow flight routes to be optimised, reducing flight time and fuel use, and therefore CO emissions, in the aviation sector.
To be precise, Eurocontrol 2 estimates that the use of collaborative air traffic management solutions in free route airspace (FRA) areas can lead to reductions of up to: one billion nautical miles, six million tons of fuel and 20 million tons of CO.

Manufacturing 3.6 Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies Technical screening criteria: The economic activity manufactures technologies that are aimed at substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings.
Indra manufactures simulators that allow training and simulation exercises to be carried out in high-precision virtual environments, which reduce the CO emissions and other types of impact on the environment that would 2 result from carrying out these exercises in a real-world setting.
Simulation Indra's flight simulators substantially reduce aviation sector GHG emissions from training aircraft pilots.
These simulators allow steps to be repeated until they have been perfected without the need to consume fuel, which would be the case if such training was to be carried out in the real world.
For an H175 helicopter for example, this would mean a saving of more than 340 litres of fuel per flight hour (given a tank capacity of 2,067 kg and a range of six hours nine minutes at an average speed of 155 km/h).
The main energy source for these simulators is electricity, which means a significant reduction in emissions compared to the fuels used in aviation (mainly kerosene), since electricity (in Spain) has a lower emission factor than kerosene (0.259 kg CO/kWh vs.
3.179 kg CO/kg kerosene).

Other key projects for the company will be MDOC, which aims to develop combat clouds for multi-domain operations, and ARTURO, which focuses on evolving the next generation of radars to respond to new threats.
Among its land-based projects, Indra will expand the capabilities of next- generation armoured vehicles as a member of the FAMOUS2 consortium, provide key systems for unmanned vehicles as part of the COMMANDS project and, through ACHILE, help equip soldiers with new sensors that will enhance their capabilities.
Indra will also play a role, through the EDINAF project, in the development of the ships of the future, as well as participating in a long list of projects covering areas such as space surveillance, the security and resiliency of satellite communications, the use of quantum technologies, and energy efficiency and independence.
Innovation in sustainability: Biodiversity and digital transformation enerTIC Awards: three Indra projects received prizes at the 2022 enerTIC awards in recognition of their commitment to sustainability: the Reads project to assess how natural capital is impacted; the bird detection solution to safeguard protected bird species on wind farms; and Madrid Multicloud, Madrid City Council s digital transformation project.

Quality auditing Internal and external quality audits are some of the main tools Indra uses to identify opportunities to improve the way products and services are developed:   External audits: in 2022, 44 external audits were carried out, including those conducted by independent and accredited firms as part of certification processes and those undertaken   in line with standard practice   at the request of clients as part of their approval processes or as a contractual requirement.
It is important to note that Indra also audits its suppliers and subcontractors to guarantee the quality of the products and services supplied to its clients (see section 7.9).
Internal audits: in 2022, the quality team completed 307 internal audits in addition to the audits carried out on business operations and those aimed at ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the Quality Management System processes.
Product health and safety conditions [GRI 417-1] Indra guarantees the highest standards of quality and safety required by legislation and industry certifications (e.g. EASA, PECAL, IRIS), as well as those expected by its end clients.
The company has also established the CE marking procedure, which informs users and competent authorities that the equipment placed on the market complies with the binding legislation regarding essential requirements, including the health and safety of products.
Sustainability Report 2022 77 Sustainability Report 2022 7.6 Client satisfaction The Corporate Quality department is responsible for monitoring client satisfaction and reporting back internally to the company's governing bodies.
To ensure that client feedback reaches these bodies correctly, the Corporate Quality department, which falls under Corporate Services and Media, is structurally independent of Indra's business lines.
The Corporate Quality department monitors the needs and opinions of clients through two main channels: the annual satisfaction survey, and the complaints and claims reported to project managers.
Taken together, these channels allow it to keep track of the main risks and opportunities arising from Indra's relationship with its clients, such as those relating to service quality, the quality of the Indra s customer service and the competitive context.
The information gathered from these two channels is presented to both the Sustainability Committee and the Board of Directors.
Survey results and records of complaints and grievances are presented at least once a year.
In order for the necessary improvements to be made, the Corporate Quality department passes on the main conclusions arrived at as part of this process to Indra's operating units.
The company has the following mechanisms for this:   Feedback Committee: a body set up in Indra's Transport and Defence markets to monitor client satisfaction and propose initiatives for improvement.
On the committee are representatives from Quality, Business Development for the Transport and Defence Markets, Legal, Management Control, Operations, Operations Transformation and Global Risks.
Minsait committees: with Minsait s Operations division, with client complaints and claims monitored quarterly, and with Markets and Verticals, as milestones for the Annual Satisfaction Survey are reached.
Complaints and claims management [GRI 417-3] [GRI 418-1] Indra has a clear process in place for dealing with complaints and claims made by its clients.
This process is subject to various internal and external reviews and audits which verify its effectiveness.
Being aware of clients  complaints and claims and how they are appropriately and effectively dealt with is essential to improve client satisfaction and the relationship with them, as well as the company s processes.
During 2022 the Quality Organisation received 32 complaints and claims, of which 78% were customer complaints and 22% were claims.
69% of all complaints and claims received were dealt with and closed in 2022 and the remainder are in the process of being managed.
Implementing improvement measures As part of the Client Experience framework, Indra continues to identify, analyse and implement improvements aimed at enhancing client relationships and increasing their loyalty and satisfaction, as well as improving processes and the quality of the products and services offered.
As part of this process of continual improvement, and as a result of the client feedback gathered from the satisfaction survey and in the form of complaints and claims, 2022 saw Indra introduce various improvements with a bearing on client satisfaction.
These include:   Holding regular meetings with important clients.
Devising action plans for clients when deemed necessary.
Setting up bodies to share insights on client experience, similar to the Feedback Committee in Regions.
Introducing a quality scorecard for complaints/claims and nonconformities for the Traffic and Defence markets, which will be rolled out to Minsait at the beginning of 2023.
Improvements to management reporting.
Identifying and measuring the costs of quality and non-quality, and establishing an economic impact matrix that determines the correlation between origins/causes and effects/typologies based on the lifecycle of the product.
Sustainability Report 2022 78 Sustainability Report 2022 7.7 Information security, privacy and data protection The company's annual double materiality assessment, described in more detail in Appendix 11.2 of this report, has identified information security and data privacy as the company's most significant sustainability topic.
This reflects the critical nature of the information managed by the systems and technologies that Indra helps to implement, as well as how important it is to customers and end users.
As a result, Indra has developed a number of policies and procedures that govern cybersecurity and privacy within the company.
Although the management systems for information security and data privacy themselves have been included in this section, it is worth noting that, as a general rule, Indra's undertakings in this area are covered in the company s Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance and Human Rights Policy.
In this way, Indra recognises that for every one of the stakeholders with whom it interacts, data security and privacy is a fundamental human right, and the company therefore complies with its obligation to respect and defend these rights.
Governance of information security and data protection [GRI 418-1] Indra s objective is that all places and channels where information can be stored or transmitted from guarantee: Critical cybersecurity incidents   Its confidentiality, ensuring that only authorised parties who need to 0 have access   on a need-to-know-basis   can access the information, thus avoiding problems of leaks or unintentional deletions of sensitive Percentage of employees trained information.
in information security and data protection   Its integrity, ensuring information and the methods used to process it are accurate and complete, avoiding any potential unauthorised 95% modifications.
Its availability, ensuring that the authorised users can access the information and its associated assets when they need to, and guaranteeing access to the company s critical systems at all times by drawing up business continuity plans.
That any alteration, loss or unauthorised processing or access of data of a personal nature is avoided.
The long-term objective is to remain cyber resilient, ensuring that cybersecurity incidents do not have a critical impact on Indra Indra has defined a global Security Governance Model that ensures the correct coordination and organisation in matters of Information Security.
The Information Security Department is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the most effective controls and procedures that will help minimise the privacy and information security risk to which the company is exposed.
On a regular basis, and at least once a year, the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) and the DPO (Data Protection Officer) report to the Board s Auditing and Compliance Committee and to the Risk Coordination Unit, informing them of the performance of the controls and any potential incidents that have occurred during the financial year.
The reports made to these governing bodies allow information security and privacy risks, as one of the main risks identified by the company, to be monitored.
The members of the Auditing and Compliance Committee have been appointed based on their experience in the management of financial and non-financial risk.
Its president, Virginia Arce, for example, has extensive experience in the field of auditing, notably for companies in the Telecommunications, Media and Technology sector, where cybersecurity risks are a major concern.
Information security management Indra has developed an Information Security Management System, certified under the ISO 27001 standard and which covers the companies representing 93% of Indra s sales and which are located in Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Italy, Portugal and the Philippines.
The system is responsible for defining, implementing and improving controls and procedures to minimise and manage the risks in the company s internal processes, in its daily operations, in the development and execution of projects, programmes and services and in client management.
Sustainability Report 2022 79 Sustainability Report 2022 93% of Indra s sales are via companies certified under the Information Security ISO 27001 standard The Information Security Strategy is based on five fundamental principles:   Governance of Information Security, ensuring the proper coordination and organisation of information security at all levels.
The Regulatory Framework on Information Security, applicable to all the company s markets and departments   as well as to all Indra s companies, branches and subsidiaries   and compliance with which is mandatory for the entire Indra collective.
The Information Security Policy, which is publicly available (together with the Privacy Policy), establishes the core principles for achieving the objectives related to confidentiality, availability and integrity.
Awareness-raising and continued training on Information Security for all company employees.
Indra also offers cybersecurity training to its suppliers following the findings of its audits.
Technology and security controls designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of both information and resources.
Audits and monitoring of compliance.
Internal audits are carried out to complete security and network control processes, procedures to audit the technical vulnerabilities of platforms and applications, and processes to validate the security architecture prior to the connection of platforms to Indra s network, as well as continuous monitoring processes.
External audits are also completed to verify compliance with all applicable regulations and international standards, as well as with the requirements established in this regard by clients.
For example, the audits completed by AENOR under the ISO 27001 standard, the financial audits, the audits of the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICFR) and TIC audits.
Additionally, Indra assesses a sample of 25 suppliers deemed critical to the company s use of information.
In the event that a flaw is identified in the data security management of these suppliers, Indra makes recommendations for improvement by referring to a Basic Guide to Cybersecurity, based on the principles and recommendations of INCIBE.
23 The company subsequently performs checks to ensure that the recommendations are being complied with, with any failure to comply potentially leading to the supplier being dropped or replaced.
In addition, to ensure that its information security management is sufficiently robust, Indra has an ISO 22301-compliant business contingency and continuity plan.
Certification to ISO 22301 standards means that Indra has the necessary governance model, strategies and recovery solutions in place to deal with a variety of disruptive scenarios, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, pandemics and armed conflicts.
The business contingency and continuity plan is tested periodically.
As part of the plan, which is governed by the company's internal regulations, various exercises were carried out in 2022 involving simulations of technical failures, malicious attacks, and other events that could threaten the continuity of Indra s services.
To ensure the proper implementation of this strategy and guarantee the company's cyber resilience, Indra periodically tests (at least once every six months on average) its information security systems using:   Cyber exercises, including targeted attacks, role-playing and simulations of security incidents, in order to prepare and increase the company s defence and resilience capabilities in response to attacks or situations of imminent risk.
Exchanges between the Red Team and Blue Team to evaluate the effectiveness of our capacity to respond to threats, based on tactics and techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK24 methodology and international framework.
Intrusion tests designed to identify possible security weaknesses.
23 Spain s National Institute for Cybersecurity 24 MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base that models cyber adversaries  behaviour, reflecting the various phases in an attack lifecycle and the platforms known to be targeted.
Sustainability Report 2022 80 Sustainability Report 2022 Data protection Since 2010, Indra has had an Office for Privacy and Data Protection, and since 2017 the Privacy and Data Protection Policy has been adapted to the requirements of Regulation EU 679/2016 (GDPR).
Additionally, the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance, compliance with which is mandatory for Indra s employees and partners, includes aspects related to information security and protection.
The Privacy and Data Protection Policy, which is publicly available, establishes that data of a personal nature collected has to be appropriate, pertinent and not excessive, and collected for explicit and legitimate ends; identifies the channels facilitated by the company so that users can exercise their rights; describes the assumptions made by the company when processing personal information; and defines what type of personal data are considered to be sensitive.
Indra is a B2B company, so its treatment of the personal data of clients which represent the legal entities with which the company holds a commercial relationship allows for no other treatment and it is therefore not necessary to use personal data for secondary purposes.
Also, in relation to the users who contact the company via its website, the legal advice on privacy recognises that the supply of information regarding products and services is the main purpose of the information collected, and this information is not used in any other way that could be considered a secondary purpose.
This principle is further supported by the principle of  data minimisation  via which Indra only gathers the minimum and purely essential information to contact other companies.
With this sole purpose, Indra maintains a register of website users who have contacted the company, storing only the minimum amount of information necessary (email and IP address and the contents of the consultation made) in accordance with applicable law.
This information is not used for any other secondary purpose given that Indra s relationship with website users does not involve the provision of services, and therefore there are no cases where the transfer of this data to other service providers is requested.
The implementation and effectiveness of the privacy policy is reviewed as part of the audits for the UNE 19601 certification of the Legal Compliance System and the ISO 27001 certification of the Information Security Management System.
Information security culture In 2022, Indra continued its work to increase security awareness and culture within the company.
To this end, in addition to the mandatory training for all staff on data security, personal data protection and data privacy described in the company s onboarding plan, a new mandatory course, based on the dos and don ts associated with the most frequent security problems, will be run annually, and is intended to provide information on the most common risk situations for the company and the specific procedures to follow in the event that they occur.
In addition, a series of courses on security is available for all employees to voluntarily sign up to, allowing them to take the training that they deem necessary.
This includes special courses on the National Security Scheme, Secure Development, Advanced Security, and Indra s Information Security and Privacy and Information Security Regulatory Framework policies, as well as access to other courses and materials on more specialised matters which are available for self-study.
Similarly, in order to increase awareness at every level, special training on information security has also been provided to the Board of Director s Audit and Compliance Committee.
Initiatives undertaken in 2022 to improve information security In 2022, the company continued to roll out the Information Security Transformation Plan that it began in 2020.
The following initiatives undertaken in 2022 in each of the five priority areas are particularly worthy of mention:   Improvements to the security of operations: The company s operations were divided up, and security management procedures adapted and developed accordingly based on the operations  level of criticality and the requirements of clients and external auditors.
Improvements to information security governance: Indra has worked to improve information security management across its operations by refining both the internal measures used by all companies belonging to the group, as well as those used by the suppliers and third parties that process information on Indra s behalf.
Sustainability Report 2022 81 Sustainability Report 2022   Improvements to the security measures applied to key company processes: Improvements to tools providing information on the exposure of the public perimeter and security controls in multicloud environments, and the removal of insecure protocols for connecting to corporate systems, etc.
Improvements to technology and the management and service model: Implementation of a zero trust security model, a device hardening system and a system for classified information based on the specifications made by Spain s National Cybersecurity Centre (CCN), and adapting of early detection tools for incidents and attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK methodology.
Greater awareness and responsible use: Indra has been working on increasing employee awareness and encouraging more responsible use by carrying out cyber exercises and simulations of phishing attacks.
This has led to increased resilience, according to measurements performed by Spain s National Institute for Cybersecurity (INCIBE).
Complaints relating to privacy and action taken as a result In 2022, Indra Sistemas S.A. was the subject of a privacy complaint, filed with the Catalan data protection authorities (Autoritat Catalana de Protecci  de Dades), relating to a service performed for a client.
The incident that led to the complaint was remedied within hours and did not involve the leaking of any sensitive data with a significant effect on individuals  privacy, nor did it involve any direct damage to the client or have an impact on the proper execution of the project.
In response to this complaint, Indra set in motion the procedures intended to be used in such cases, responding to requests from the relevant authorities in a timely and appropriate manner and reviewing its existing processes to ensure that they include response and prevention measures for avoiding this type of situation occurring.
As a result of the complaint, Indra was fined  23,000, an amount that it has already paid.
Indra continues to implement measures in relation to data protection that ensure the security and proper provision of the services that it offers its clients.
7.8 Sustainable supply chain management Indra is aware of the importance of its supply chain in meeting its objectives, both due to its international presence and the supply chain s importance and impact on the company s revenue.
The Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance, and the Supplier Sustainability Policy approved by the Board of Directors, set out the principles that Ethicsand Respectfor guide the company s procurement processes.
These are included in compliance people the Procurement Terms and Conditions for all orders, which is available to view both on the Supplier Portal and the company website.
Respectfortheenvironment Indra s Procurement Department is tasked with setting the strategy and procedures for the procurement of services and products, as well as overseeing this process and ensuring that the strategic objectives Principles of the Supplier Sustainability Policy for Suppliers established by the Board of Directors are met.
One of the aims of the procurement strategy is to effectively incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into the company s supply chain management.
Indra s commitments to excellence in the supply chain:   Transparency, ethics and compliance   Local impact (purchases from local suppliers)   Independence   Reliability and efficiency   Value generation and competitiveness The aim is to secure the best suppliers via business procedures designed to ensure transparency and equality of conditions for all bidders.
Indra periodically identifies the suppliers that it deems most critical in terms of income generated, how essential the products/services provided are, associated risks and the extent to which the company is dependent on the supplier.
Given the nature of its business, the most critical procurements for Indra as a whole are those related to the outsourcing of production, the purchase of equipment, and electrical and electronic components.
During the purchasing process, Indra ensures that a supplier risk assessment is carried out.
The following risks in particular are gauged: credit risk, fraud risk, cybersecurity, ethics, ESG, human resources and tax risk.
The volume of purchases Indra makes from a given supplier is directly correlated to its local presence and the projects it carries out in these countries, and is consistent with its practice of encouraging partnerships with local suppliers.
By looking specifically at the ESG risks associated with suppliers, the company aims to determine the impact of its supply chain on sustainable development, as well as to identify any operational, legal or reputational risks that might arise from its cooperation with suppliers.
Sustainability Report 2022 82 Sustainability Report 2022 Sustainable supply chain management [GRI 308-1] [GRI 308-2] [GRI 407-1] [GRI-408-1] [GRI 409-1] [GRI 412-1] [GRI 414-1] [GRI 414-2] It is Indra s responsibility to encourage its suppliers to improve their ethical, social and environmental performance.
With this in mind, Indra has developed a management model for suppliers and incorporated ESG principles into every stage of the supplier management process.
In the supplier approval phase, an initial evaluation is carried out before the supplier is authorised to provide products or services to Indra.
All suppliers must pass this stage without exception.
Indra verifies that its suppliers are aligned with the company's policies, codes and operating principles.
In order to receive approval, suppliers must meet the following criteria (listed in order of importance):   Acceptance of Code of Ethics and Legal   Evidence of a stable financial position and Compliance absence of credit risk   Compliance with applicable local law in   Reputational risk supplier s country   Sustainability performance   Civil liability (for certain contracts) Indra requires its approved suppliers to comply with applicable local laws in relation to occupational risk prevention, as well as any associated legislation.
The supplier undertakes to provide the required documentation to fulfil these obligations within the framework of the services provided.
In 2022, the Procurement Department began the process of introducing a global model for evaluating suppliers  sustainability performance which would Critical suppliers assessed using be adapted to Indra's global presence and based on the ESG criteria.
ESG criteria Suppliers are evaluated by measuring how well they perform in areas such as Climate Change risk management, Human Rights due diligence, talent 70% management, and information security and privacy.
In addition to this, critical suppliers must also provide evidence and documentation supporting their Volume of purchases in countries claims and attesting to their performance.
The three bases on which suppliers with a high sustainable are evaluated are their environmental (management policies and system, development score carbon footprint), social (Human Rights and employment practices) and governance (ethics and compliance, information security) standards.
(SDG Index Score) By the end of 2022, 70% of Indra's critical suppliers had been evaluated using 97% the company s sustainability criteria.
Of these suppliers, 66% exceeded the level of sustainability considered adequate (scoring more than 51 points out of a possible 100).
The objective in carrying out an ESG As Supplier evaluation of suppliers is not only to allow Indra to select those that Engagement perform best from a sustainability perspective, but also to motivate Leader Indra suppliers to improve their ESG works with its performance, thereby increasing their competitiveness.
suppliers to To determine the level of risk that the extend company assumes through its supply chain as a result of the local contexts environmental in which its suppliers operate, Indra refers to the SDG Index Score25, measures to which uses indicators such as peace, its supply prosperity, and care for people and the planet.
Of the purchases Indra chain makes from direct suppliers, 97% come from countries with a high sustainable development score26.
The procurement process is periodically subjected to an internal audit.
The recommendations and opportunities for improvement that emerge from these reviews are analysed and implemented, and their implementation is then periodically monitored to ensure the continual improvement of the company s processes.
During the audits performed in 2022, no significant weaknesses were detected.
25 The SDG Index Score is a summary index developed by Bertelsmann Stiftung, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Cambridge University Press that measures each country's level of progress towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
26 A high SDG Index Score is a score of 70 points or more out of 100.
Sustainability Report 2022 83 Sustainability Report 2022 Social and Human Rights requirements for suppliers Indra promotes and defends the protection of Human Rights in its supply chain.
Since 2017 it has required all of its approved suppliers to accept and comply with its Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance, which are included in the General Procurement Terms and Conditions.
The Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance reflects the company s commitment and what it requires its suppliers to respect: the International Declaration of Human Rights, the principles relating to the rights set out in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization and the principles of the United Nations Global Compact.
In addition, compliance with Indra's Supplier Sustainability Policy, in place since 2021, is also mandatory for suppliers, and this policy forms part of the company s General Procurement Terms and Conditions.
Similarly, Indra has a Statement on Conflict Minerals, which sets out its commitment to not use minerals or components in its products that have been extracted from  conflict  mines.
Thereby further strengthening its responsibility in the defence of Human Rights throughout its value chain.
In 2022, there were no incidents involving suppliers and the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining or the use of child or forced/non-consensual labour, nor is there any record of complaints in this regard having been received.
Moreover, no suppliers were identified as having a significant negative social impact.
In 2022, five suppliers were reported through the mechanism set up to handle complaints (the Direct Channel).
All reports were investigated and there were no confirmed findings.
For more information, see section 4.1.
Carbon footprint training for suppliers In 2022, the Environment team launched a series of training sessions on carbon footprint for certain critical suppliers in Spain selected for their emissions intensity.
Over 100 suppliers were asked to attend, representing more than 15% of Indra's total emissions from purchases.
The sessions focused on explaining the basic principles for calculating carbon footprint, the importance of monitoring CO2 emissions, future regulatory requirements in this area, and how to record emissions through the platform that Indra has set up for its suppliers.
Thanks to this initiative, the ESG and carbon footprint information on suppliers available to Indra has increased 143% for those suppliers who attended the sessions.
Responsibility to suppliers Indra is committed to the sustainability of its supply chain and developing production and the social fabric locally.
The company is therefore mindful of the following when setting out terms:   Ensuring that invoices are paid within an interval that does not extend beyond local legal limits, and that such payment terms are in no way abusive towards the supplier.
Maintaining stable relationships with suppliers that provide them with visibility in terms of levels of cooperation into the long term, as well as financial and economic security.
Working with local suppliers whenever possible.
Supply chain: purchases from local suppliers [GRI 204-1] In 2022,  1,843 million worth of purchase orders were placed with more than 6,600 approved suppliers in over 87 countries.
27 By purchasing from local Local suppliers (no.
) suppliers, Indra contributes to the development and growth of the business 85% network in its local communities.
In 2022, 77% of purchases were made through local suppliers   meaning that 85% of all approved suppliers were local.
Suppliers are considered to be local when their country of origin SME suppliers in Spain (registered address) coincides with that of the purchaser.
The high volumes 71% of local purchases made by Indra are a driver of growth in the regions in which it operates, stimulating business growth and industrial and social development within these countries through the creation of jobs at the companies supplying products and services.
27 Supplier data covers 91% of Indra s total purchases and does not include purchases made by companies that do not use the corporate procurement model, such as Indra Navia, Avitech and Indra USA, although Avitech is expected to be incorporated in 2023.
Sustainability Report 2022 84 Sustainability Report 2022 8 Society and commitment to local communities 8.1 Social investment and volunteering [GRI 203-1] [GRI 203-2] [GRI 413-1] Indra is committed to making a meaningful contribution to the socio-economic development of the communities where it operates.
It therefore believes that Investment in social projects contributing to the sustainability of the communities where it operates forms  1.3 million part of the company s responsibility and long-term value creation aims for all its stakeholders.
At the same time, Indra firmly believes that, to maximise the Volunteers (no.
) positive impact it has on its local communities, it must focus its support for social causes through initiatives that are closely linked to its core business +900 and to areas in which the company is most skilled: promoting knowledge and innovation.
In 2022, Indra s investment in social action shrank 26% compared to 2021, as a result of allocating more funds to hiring through Special Employment Centres and the increased amount of people with disabilities forming part of the company s workforce   in line with the General Act on the Rights of Persons with Disability.
Indra champions a variety of initiatives   direct donations, accessible technology projects and corporate volunteering   that all form part of four key lines of action: Accessible technology, improving the environment, promotion of STEM careers and support to groups at risk of exclusion and to children.
These key lines of action for social initiatives take on a different form in each of the countries where Indra operates and are also tailored to the specific needs of each region s local community.
Appendix 11.6 to this report details the main social impact initiatives undertaken by country.
Accessible Support for groups at Technologies risk of exclusion and for children Promoting STEM vocations Improving the environment 4 key lines of action Sustainability Report 2022 85 Sustainability Report 2022 Developing accessible technologies As a technology company, Indra understands that it has a significant capacity both to resolve the problems encountered by people with disabilities through the use of technology and to reduce the digital gap in accessing technology and the services that may be associated with this group.
In 2022, as well as promoting inclusive technology, Indra spearheaded, together with the FDI Foundation and HandsOn Spain, the second call for the entrepreneurship platform Ventures4inclusi n which is open to innovative tech-based projects presented by people with disabilities and charitable organisations and designed to help this collective access the jobs market.
Promoting STEM careers Many of the markets where Indra operates are suffering from a shortage of professionals with STEM qualifications and skills, areas that are key to the company s business.
The company therefore believes that promoting STEM careers will not only benefit the communities where it operates, but also the company s long-term interests by ensuring the future availability of qualified professionals in these fields.
As such, Indra aims to promote the presence of women with disabilities in STEM positions, collaborating once again in the third edition of the RADIA initiative.
Currently only one out of every six employed ICT specialists is a woman.
In addition, having a disability only makes it even more difficult for women to enter higher education and find employment.
This is why the RADIA initiative seeks to offer training and employment that includes more women with disabilities in the digital sector, recognising both the value of their contribution and their talent, factors which are key to building an inclusive, competitive and dynamic digital society.
Improving the environment Indra is committed to protecting the environment and contributing to the fight against Climate Change.
It is therefore important for the company to take action that can partially offset its environmental impacts, while at the same time help it to improve its employee relations and their pride in being a part of the company.
Indra engages in volunteer work that as well as helping to conserve and restore the ecosystem also helps to integrate people at risk of social exclusion.
In 2022, in collaboration with Fundaci n FDI (Fundaci n para el Fomento del Desarrollo y la Integraci n) the company took part in an initiative to repopulate forests across Spain.
The initiative saw close to 280 Indra employees volunteer and join forces with over 200 people with learning disabilities from ten social organisations across various provinces and with conservation specialists to take part in the project.
Supporting groups in danger of exclusion and children Access to and demand for technology is heavily dependent on an individual s socio-economic profile.
The greater the level of development, the greater the demand for technology.
As such, Indra firmly believes that supporting socio- economic development and eliminating any kind of risk of social exclusion benefits both the community and the company itself.
Together with the Red Cross, Indra works to support primary and secondary school children in Spain in their learning and homework to reduce the risk of social exclusion and help secure them a more successful future.
Indra has also strengthened its social commitment by collaborating with the CEOE Foundation in its Sustainable Digitalisation campaign and providing the Labdoo non-profit with laptops.
Employee participation in social initiatives Indra is a socially responsible company committed to sustainable development, which helps to encourage, channel and expand the positive impact of its employees, clients and collaborators on the planet and on individuals.
In 2022, Indra continued to encourage its employees to participate in various social Volunteering in 2022 initiatives designed to help the most vulnerable groups.

Since 1 July 1999 Indra has also formed part of the IBEX 35 selective index, which includes the leading 35 companies in the Spanish securities market in terms of market capitalisation and liquidity.
The shareholders in the graph below have a holding of more than 3% registered on the CNMV s official site at the end of 2022.

With regard to the position of Mr. Joseph Oughourlian, it should be noted that 3.24% of his stake is held directly by Amber Capital Investment Management ICAV - Amber Global Opportunities Fund, which is a fund managed by Amber Capital UK LLP, which has the discretion to exercise voting rights.
The remaining interest (1.89% of the share capital) is held by other funds managed by the Amber management companies.
On 22 February 2022 the Cabinet announced its decision to allow SEPI to acquire an additional 10% of Indra s capital and thereby take its stake up to 28%.
In its notification to the CNMV, SEPI stated that its decision was a response to the State s commitment to the company, which had taken on particularly important challenges relating to the national interest (FCAS) and the interests of the country's closest allies, and was also aimed at providing the company with shareholder stability.
On 16 September 2022, the Council of Ministers announced that it was granting authorisation for joint foreign investment in the Spanish company Indra Sistemas, S.A. from the companies Amber Capital UK, LLP (United Kingdom) and Amber Capital Italia SGR, S.P.A. (Italy), up to a joint total holding, either in shares or other financial instruments representing shares in the said company in the form of underlying value, amounting to 9.99% of the share capital.
Shareholder rights As set out in the Regulations governing the General Shareholders  Meeting, Indra s relations with its shareholders are founded on principles of equal treatment among shareholders, transparency and the continuous provision of comprehensive information.
Under Article 12 of the Regulations, each share entitles the holder to one vote, and the resolutions proposed at the General Shareholders  Meeting are adopted by a simple majority of votes, except where the Law requires a specific majority.
Under the terms of Article 3 bis of the Regulations and Article 519 of the Spanish Companies Act, any shareholder representing at least 3% of the company s share capital may ask for an item to be included in the Meeting s agenda, or submit proposals on items already in the Meeting s agenda.
Sustainability Report 2022 89 Sustainability Report 2022 As a way of encouraging shareholder participation, before convening a Meeting, Indra sends out a notice to all of the company s shareholders, inviting them to submit proposals for items to be included in the Meeting s agenda.
The rights of shareholders to participate in the General Shareholders  Meeting are explained in the company s internal regulations, as well as in the notice in which each General Shareholders  Meeting is convened.
The two basic channels through which shareholders can access information are the company website, particularly the Shareholders and Investors section, and the Shareholders  Office.
Under the Shareholders and Investors section, the sub-section relating to Corporate Governance includes comprehensive information on the company s General Shareholders  Meetings, including ways in which shareholders can take part, the agenda and the results of any votes taken.
In addition, as a measure designed to increase transparency for shareholders and the various shareholder groups, every General Shareholders  Meeting is broadcast live on the Indra website.
Once the Meeting has ended, a recording of the session is also made publicly available on the Indra website.
In addition, while every General Shareholders  Meeting is being held, the Shareholders  Office remains open to shareholders as a point of access between them and the company.
Relationship model The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the information provided to shareholders, institutional investors and the various stakeholders at the highest level.
It is also responsible for maintaining contact and communications with all of these groups, ensuring, protecting and facilitating the exercise of their rights and interests within the framework of defending the Company s interests, all in accordance with the following general principles: i) Transparency and veracity of information; ii) Equality of treatment in the distribution of information; iii) A guarantee that information can be accessed by all target audiences via the use of adequate information vehicles; iv) Compliance with the provisions set out in Law, the Company s internal regulations and the recommendations relating to Corporate Governance, along with the principles of cooperation and transparency with the authorities, regulatory bodies and competent administrative bodies.
In accordance with Recommendation 4 of the Code of Good Governance for Listed Companies, the company has a policy for communicating with shareholders, institutional investors, proxy advisors and other stakeholders, and criteria for reporting financial data, non-financial data and corporate information.
Most notably, the policy regulates the various channels for communicating with and informing the public and the markets in general, the main channels being:   The General Shareholders  Meeting is the main way in which Indra s shareholders can participate.
Communication with the CNMV (Spanish Securities Markets Commission) and other regulatory bodies to notify the market of any information that is classified as privileged or relevant under the legislation in force.
The company website is the main channel used by the company to communicate with and inform its shareholders, institutional investors, proxy advisors and the markets in general.
Regular informative meetings (roadshows) with shareholders, institutional investors and proxy advisors.
Conference calls and webcasts via which Indra presents its quarterly results to investors and analysts.
Shareholders  office: channel available to all shareholders to answer their questions and offer any other information they may require.
Investor magazine: a digital means of communication specifically aimed at minority shareholders.
Widely accepted and broadly distributed traditional media outlets and social media networks that are present and followed in the European Union.
This distribution is carried out adhering to the recommendations and criteria set out by the CNMV for this matter.
9.3 Associations and foundations [GRI 2-28] [GRI 415-1] Indra works with a large number of associations and foundations, with a view to achieving a broad range of goals, including:   Further develop the company s political, economic and social intelligence   Increase the company s external visibility, improving its positioning and protecting and enhancing its reputation   Apply Indra s focus on open innovation through the development of innovation-based projects   Work on social action programmes to benefit the local communities where the company operates.
In some cases, the legal remit of the associations and foundations that Indra collaborates with, includes the power to consult with State bodies with regard to the public policies implemented by government (such as, for example, the Spanish Chamber of Commerce).
Any actions that may result in influence from a company such as Indra being applied through these institutions, is therefore governed by law.
These associations and foundations are the only intermediary to the regulator, outside of the company itself.
Sustainability Report 2022 90 Sustainability Report 2022 Indra is not aware of having collaborated with any type of organisation whose objective could be understood to be political influence and has therefore made no contribution to lobbying or representation of interests, organisations or similar; to political campaigns, organisations or candidates; or any other expense associated with political influence.
When Indra enters into agreements with different kinds of associations or engages in direct contact with governments or their representatives abroad, it is careful to ensure that their lobbying activities conform to the same principles of cooperation and transparency that are set out in Indra s own Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance.
The Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance sets out the following obligations for Indra s employees in this regard:   The prohibition of donations to political parties: the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance prohibits any direct or indirect financing of political parties, their representatives or candidates.
The prohibition of facilitating payments and restrictions on corporate hospitality: under the appendix on corporate hospitality, the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance prohibits so called facilitating payments and limits the conditions and amounts in which Indra employees are allowed to offer business gifts to public officials.
As the Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance sets out, Indra s internal procedures and processes include certain additional control measures relating to the engagement of politically exposed persons, given the greater risk of bribery and corruption to which these kinds of relations are subject.
Indra is committed to complying with the legislation in force regarding transparency of lobbying activities.
The table of non-financial indicators in the appendix to this report includes the breakdown of the total contributions to associations and foundations.
In 2022, Indra maintained collaborative relationships with associations in the general sphere and its own sector or linked to lobbying and dialogue.
The most relevant are listed below: Transport and Defence AED   Aeronautics, Space and Defence Cluster EOS   European Organisation for Security UNIFE - European Rail Supply Industry Association Eurocae ALAMYS - Latin American Metro and Subway Association ITS Spain - New Technologies in Transport Forum ASD   Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of MAFEX - Spanish Railway Association Europe TEDAE - Spanish Association of Defence Technologies, Security, CANSO   Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation Aeronautics and Space UITP   International Association of Public Transport Information Technology ABES - Brazilian Association of Software Companies AEC - Spanish Association of Consulting Companies AMITI   Mexican Association of Information Technologies ENERTIC Platform - Platform for ICT companies for the Industry improvement of energy efficiency Innovation and Sustainability AEC - Spanish Quality Association Spanish Platform for Climate Action Global Compact OECC - Spanish Climate Change Office For tica Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation Foundations and associations devoted to forming relationships with foreign states Spain-Australia Council Foundation Spain-USA Council Foundation Spain-Brazil Council Foundation Spain-India Council Foundation Spain-China Council Foundation Spain-Peru Council Foundation Spain-Colombia Council Foundation Fundaci n Iberoamericana Empresarial Sustainability Report 2022 91 Sustainability Report 2022 In 2022, Indra contributed a total of  1,557,231 ( 1,717,605 in 2021) to associations and organisations associated with political and institutional lobbying.
The most significant of these contributions are listed below: Most significant contributions (not an exhaustive list) ASD   European, Aerospace 78,746 A E C   S p a n is h A s s o c i a t i o n f o r 4 3 , 600 and Security Association C o n s u l t in g C o m p a n i es TEDAE   Spanish 76,188 Spanish Chamber of Commerce 65,000 Organization for Aerospace and Defence EOS   European 14,520 Confederation of Employers and 25,000 Organization for Security Industries of Spain (CEOE) UITP   International 24,950 Association of Public Transport UNIFE - European Rail 13,390 Supply Industry In short, the company s public lobbying activities are directed towards supporting its business interests, stressing the importance of investment in innovation and its potential to contribute to economic and social development, and highlighting the impact of the company s products and services on society, on people and, therefore, on the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
In this way, the company showcases the positive effects of innovation and technology and their potential to make a contribution in a range of areas such as energy, health, education, financial inclusion, access to essential resources such as water, sustainable mobility, security and defence, combatting Climate Change through solutions aimed both at adapting and mitigating its effects, improving the way in which public administrations operate, and promoting and consolidating democratic societies through transparent election processes that are in line with international standards.
Indra therefore legitimately promotes its commercial interests within the limits imposed by the company s Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance.
9.4 ESG indices and analysts In 2022, and for a second consecutive year, Indra was named the global leader of the IT Services sector, after achieving the highest score on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI).
The company leads the ranking in terms of social criteria, achieving the sector s maximum score in innovation, privacy, social and environmental reporting, workplace practices, attracting talent, climate strategy, institutional relations, fiscal strategy and corporate citizenship.
After being included in the index for 17 uninterrupted years, maintaining the highest position for the second year running is the ultimate recognition of Indra s commitment to improving its financial, social and environmental performance, using technology to make its contribution to the 2030 Agenda and increasing the positive impact that it has on people and on the planet.
These results are testament to the continued effort made by the company to place sustainability at the heart of its stated mission and strategy.
2022 also saw Indra rated an A-List company in the fight against Climate Change by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).
A classification that easily outstrips the sector average (C).
This is true recognition of the company s environmental strategy which is fully integrated into its management of Climate Change risks and opportunities.
Indra also obtained the highest rating for areas such as its governance model for climate-related issues, emissions reduction targets and its carbon footprint.
Other indices such the FTSE4Good and the MSCI-ESG rating agency have also recognised Indra s practices in matters of sustainability as far superior to the sector average.
In fact, in 2022, Sustainalytics lowered Indra s ESG risk rating, with the company remaining in a low-risk category (12.9), a level that places it in percentile 3 for the Software and Services sector and percentile 4 for the IT Consulting sub-sector.
In 2022, Indra was also included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for a third consecutive year, and it was also certified once again as a Top Employer along with Minsait.
These acknowledgements recognise the good practices of Indra and Minsait in talent management, especially the group s commitment to gender equality.

Sustainability Report 2022 93 Sustainability Report 2022 10 Financial and non-financial risk management The risk factors which affect Indra depend on the countries where it carries out its activities and the nature of the sectors in which it operates.
Indra aims to identify and evaluate the risks so that it can introduce measures far enough in advance in order to mitigate the probability of these risks actually materialising and/or having a potential impact on its business objectives.
The main risks that affect Indra implementing its strategy are outlined in section 8 of the Management Report.
Risk management policies and procedures Indra s Risk Management and Control System is a process advocated by the Board of Directors and Senior Management, the responsibility of which falls upon each and every member of the company.
The purpose of the system is to provide reasonable certainty regarding the achievement of the established objectives.
The Risk Management System, externally certified under the ISO 31000 standard, places a special focus on ESG risk assessment In 2022 Indra renewed its Risk Management certification with AENOR under the ISO 31000 standard.
This highlights that the company s Risk Control and Management System is compliant with the principles, processes and best practices in terms of governance and accredits the effective integration of risk management across the group s operations, with the special consideration of non-financial aspects related to its performance in matters of ESG and Climate Change in the internal and external risk factor management process.
RiskManagement Process Identification of internal and Definition of effective risk external events affecting the information flows.
The company's objectives objectives are to ensure that key issues are known, appropriate decision making is made and stakeholder Identification of the possible expectations are met causes and consequences of risks in terms of probability of occurrence and impact Continuous monitoring of risks by means of tools to Selection of possible assess their evolution responses by the company's management Definition of actions to align risks with the company's risk acceptance and risk tolerances This certification is valid for three years, with annual audits ensuring that the key elements of the system are effectively in place, and that the company continues to strive to make continual progress and improvements.
This allows Indra to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability and further strengthen its resilience, as continually identifying and managing threats and opportunities places the company in a privileged position regarding the challenges faced in an increasingly competitive and ever-changing global environment.
In terms of adapting to an ever-changing world, Indra regularly updates its Risk Management and Control Policy, which was approved by the Board of Directors in 2016.
The last review was conducted in 2022 and is available on the website.
In addition to the Policy, Indra also has policies and procedures in places for its main processes.
These are also reviewed and regularly updated to ensure compliance with the legislation in force and the best risk management practices.
Sustainability Report 2022 94 Sustainability Report 2022 Indra s Global Risks Unit has a Risk Management Manual which outlines the processes for the company s risk identification and management.
The main procedures for Indra s risk management include:   Risk Management and Control Policy   Indra Project Management and Project Risk   Risk Management Manual and procedures Management Method   Risk management criteria   Procurement Policies and Procedures   Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance   Sustainability Policy   Criminal Risk Prevention Programme   Human Rights Policy   Competition Risk Prevention Programme   Diversity Policy   Policies and procedures for Business   Director Remuneration Policy Continuity, Information Security and Privacy   Environmental Policy Protection   Position on Climate Change   Occupational Risk Management System   Energy Policy Prevention Programme   Statement on  Conflict Minerals    Human Resources Policies   Tendering Committee Regulations   Tax Policy For further information on the description of the risks and the Risk Management and Control System, please see section 8 of the Management Report and section E of the Annual Corporate Governance Report, both of which are available on the company website.

The company identifies its global risks through specific analysis of recognised sources, internal documents and interviews with key employees.
It also regularly monitors risks and mitigation actions and, as with the Risk Map, reports its findings to the Auditing and Compliance Committee in the interests of its risk supervisory obligations.
Additionally, Indra has formal committees for identifying risks.
These allow employees to proactively identify and report potential risks as soon as a project enters the bidding stage.
These risks are documented in the corporate tools.
Indra has management tools that enable the company to identify, quantify and propose measures to mitigate risks throughout the entire lifecycle of a project.
Finally, monitoring committees are set up to identify and analyse risks related to the company s operations.
Disclosure and training: the company s key values (set out in the definition of its culture) are actively notified to all Indra employees via the various channels at the company s disposal, including the onboarding courses for new recruits and the company s intranet.
In 2022, the Global Risks Unit has carried out culture initiatives by updating its risk management criteria and distributing the risk map and the risk functions to the Steering Committees and the Senior Management of the main geographies where the company operates, such as Italy, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
As part of the annual process to update Indra s Training Plan, the company identifies training requirements, including those that may be associated with risk management.
In 2022, via its Training Plan Indra developed specific training to target important areas such as people management, occupational risk prevention, cybersecurity, project management and the management of tenders, tax management, ethics and compliance.
Via these courses, the company controls risk such as talent retention, health and safety, information security and privacy, compliance with project milestones, fiscal compliance, competition and corruption and bribery.
Screening and performance assessments: the professional profiles of the positions at Indra (particularly in the case of the management team) and annual performance assessments are based on the company s key values and incorporate the principles of risk management.
Remuneration and financial incentives: the company s remuneration system is aligned with risk management principles.
At the highest level of the organisation, decisions on the remuneration of Indra s executive directors and senior management incorporate the necessary precautions to avoid assuming excessive risks and rewarding unfavourable management results, as reflected in the Remuneration Policy.
The variable remuneration paid to the heads of departments that manage company risk (e.g. the departments of compliance, prevention of occupational risk, information security, etc.
) is dependent upon the proper management, disclosure and integration of risks throughout the whole company.
Section 7.5 of this report describes the measures taken to integrate risk management into the products and services offered by the company.

Sustainability Report 2022 96 Sustainability Report 2022 Emerging risks As part of the risk-management cycle described above, Indra includes a timeline that allows it to identify, assess and manage any risks that may have an impact on the business over the medium or long term and that may require specific mitigation or response measures.
As an example of these emerging risks identified by Indra, two particularly worthy of note are the difficulty the EU is facing to bring down inflation, and the geopolitical polarisation caused by the conflict in Ukraine and the reversal of globalisation that this has caused.
High inflation in Europe over a prolonged period Description A total of 67% of the company's revenue comes from Europe (50% from Spain).
In 2022, the region was particularly affected by the high level of inflation that came with the gradual shift to post-Covid economic recovery beginning as early as the end of 2021.
This was then aggravated by the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which spread to the economy as a whole thanks to higher industrial and transportation costs.
Although the general trend since July 2022 has been for inflation to fall, inflation in Spain remains at levels not seen since 1992.
In addition to which, the European Central Bank s use of monetary policies to curb inflation by raising interest rates are increasing the cost of debt and serving to encourage investments and discourage spending in the economy.
Although the impact of all this has at least been partially mitigated in 2022 by circumstances such as fixed rates on debt and salaries remaining stable, if high inflation persists, it will end up having an effect on the company's financial and personnel costs once it has to carry out its annual salary reviews and review its debt and financing structure and agreements.
The risk is therefore that high inflation and interest rates will persist over a prolonged period or be compounded by a slowdown in economic activity.
Impact on Indra Indra is exposed to this risk as a result of its strong presence in Europe, and particularly in Spain.
Its intensive use of talent (and the associated risk of wage inflation) also play a role, as does the need for investment in its Transport and Defence and Information Technology businesses in order to retain a technological edge.
If Indra fails to pass this inflation in costs on to its customers, it would result in lower profitability and less capacity to invest.
Moreover, measures such as wage restraint could lead to increased employee turnover and a loss of productivity.
Finally, if higher interest rates are sustained over a longer period, this will have an effect on the cost of the company s debt.
In short, persistent inflation could affect Indra s capacity to innovate and have an impact on ongoing and future projects, the quality of its products and services and, more generally, the company's competitiveness.
Mitigating measures On the whole, the policies aimed at improving operational efficiency that Indra has been implementing in recent years (such as Minsait's Operational Transformation Plan, Margin Boost in Transport and Defence, Lean Making and automated testing) should make it possible to absorb part of the cost increases associated with inflation.
However, the company has plans to adopt special measures if the risk persists over time, such as:   Continuing with its strategy to optimise the cost of its debt through diversification.
Introducing wage restraint measures, to be compensated for by other, non-monetary benefits connected with flexibility and work-life balance in order to mitigate any impact on employee turnover.
Distributing the workload more evenly among the different countries in which Indra operates by offshoring more of its production to locations where inflation has been lower and which offer a cost advantage over Europe.
Sustainability Report 2022 97 Sustainability Report 2022 Geopolitical polarisation and its reversal of globalisation Description More than a year into Russia's invasion of Ukraine and with no near-term resolution in sight, there is a risk of the conflict persisting and becoming endemic.
The sanctions imposed by the EU and other Western countries continue to escalate.
Russia s isolation from the West is prompting it to strengthen its ties with other countries, such as China.
This could lead to the formation of two opposing blocs that do not see eye to eye geopolitically, and result in an escalation of the conflict in commercial, economic or military terms.
It is in this context that countries have become increasingly concerned with assuring their independence and sovereignty in areas such as energy, raw materials, technology and industry.
Problems affecting the energy market, global supply chains, and barriers to export (due to increased protectionism) could be aggravated and become persistent.
Impact on Indra For Indra s Transport and Defence division, it is important to ensure that the cost of the raw materials (mainly metals) and components (semiconductors, electronic components, etc.
) needed to manufacture products remains stable.
At the same time, many T&D projects apply the export model (teams are deployed to different locations for implementation).
Protectionism and greater geopolitical polarisation could lead to reduced sales for the company, as well as higher supply costs and delays to production.
Mitigating measures The main mitigation measures adopted by Indra involved:   Diversifying the supply chain.
Proper stock planning for the materials needed to manufacture products.
Indra constantly monitors the state of its supply chains, and in the event of any disruption to these, its reserves of materials are increased by making advance purchases to prevent gaps in their supply.
Developing local capacity in the different countries in which the company operates through alliances with local partners, and knowledge and technology transfer.
Sustainability Report 2022 98 Sustainability Report 2022 Impact of the conflict in Ukraine on Indra's business The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian military had wide-ranging repercussions for the economy in 2022, resulting in economic downturn and high inflation which worsened as the year progressed, particularly in Europe.
The conflict has had little direct impact on Indra's business, as it has no permanent local presence or implementation companies based in the countries involved in the conflict (i.e. Russia, Ukraine and Belarus).
In the rest of Eastern Europe, Indra has a limited presence (less than 1% of its entire workforce* as of the end of 2022).
Indra's priority has been to ensure the safety of its professionals working in countries close to the conflict.
Indra s Corporate Security team are carefully monitoring the situation in the region, and while such a scenario is highly unlikely to ever occur, evacuation plans are in place for local personnel should they be needed.
With regard to energy, the conflict and the resultant shortage of natural gas from Russia have resulted in a change in Europe s energy mix.
This has not, however, affected Indra's climate targets.
Spain and Portugal   which account for 87% of the company s electricity use   benefit from their status as  energy islands  and have an energy mix that is not dependent on Russian fossil fuels.
** Indra is therefore pressing ahead with its energy transition plan based on science-based targets (SBT), committing to the use of renewable energies (100% in Spain and Italy, and 88% globally) and the implementation of energy efficiency measures, with more than one million euros invested in Spain in 2022.
For further information, please refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2022, Note 2.
(*) NB: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland and Romania (**) NB: In January 2022, Russian fuels accounted for just 2% of oil imports and 6% of gas imports, according to data from CORES, Spain s Corporation for Strategic Reserves of Petroleum Products.
Moreover, since mid-2021, Spain has halved its imports.

This report includes the information required to understand the risks, business model, policies, strategy, performance, results and the situation of the Group and the impact of its activity in relation to environmental and social issues, as well as those relating to staff, respect for Human Rights and combatting corruption and bribery.
In line with its commitment to continual improvement regarding transparency, before preparing this report, Indra carried out a review of its materiality assessment, which led it to review the structure of the content and indicators used in the report.
More specifically, the structure of the report has been aligned with Indra s 2020-2023 Sustainability and Social Impact Master Plan and the contents relating to the environment, Climate Change, data privacy and other emerging risks have been substantially revised.
The 2022 Sustainability Report refers to the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, with the last report published in March 2022.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the following recommendations, standards and regulations:   Act 11 of 28 December 2018, amending the Spanish Commercial Code; the consolidated text of the Spanish Companies Act, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1 of 2 July 2010; and Act 22 of 20 July 2015, on Auditing Accounts in matters of non-financial information and diversity.

Sustainability Report 2022 102 Sustainability Report 2022 11.2 Double materiality assessment [GRI 3-1] [GRI 3-2] [GRI 3-3] Prior to preparing the Sustainability Report, each year Indra updates its corporate materiality assessment in order to define the content that would be relevant to its stakeholders and identify non-financial aspects that would have a bearing on the sustainability and value creation of its business operations in the short, medium and long term.
As well as defining the way in which this report is structured, the topics identified as material have an impact on the company s decision-making processes.
Likewise, the materiality analysis also allows Indra to identify its non-material topics in line with the characteristics of its business model, and as described throughout this report.
In recent years, Indra has been progressively adapting to the new methodological requirements for materiality assessments imposed by the new versions of the GRI Standards (particularly GRI 3) and EFRAG's draft European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRSs).
Specifically, since 2020, Indra has been assessing material topics from the perspective of the impact they have on all stakeholders, as well as their financial impact on the company (in terms of revenue and costs), in a way that is more or less aligned with the new concept of  double materiality  developed by EFRAG.
In addition, and with a view to expanding on this impact materiality approach, in 2021 Indra conducted a comprehensive impact study to quantify, including in monetary terms, the contribution to sustainable development that it makes as a corporation and through the solutions and services that it provides.
In 2022, Indra updated its double materiality assessment, allowing it to take greater account of EFRAG s reporting standards.
In order to prepare the double materiality assessment, Indra follows the procedure indicated below: 1.
Identification of potentially material topics.
As in previous years, Indra has taken  topics  to mean anything of significance for the company in terms of the impacts (whether positive or negative) that it has on people and the environment, and the risks and opportunities presented by the business environment in which Indra operates.
This is all also considered from a value chain perspective which takes into account both the company s own operations and its links with business partners.
In order to identify potentially material topics, Indra referred to the following information sources:   2021 Indra materiality assessment.
Reporting rules and standards: Spanish Act 11/2018 on the reporting of non-financial information and diversity, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards and the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) materiality map.
ESG investment analysts: ISS-Oekom, DJSI, FTSE4Good, VigeoEiris and MSCI-ESG.
World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Risks Report.
2.
External prioritisation in accordance with ESG reporting standards and investment analysts: Indra uses these external arbiters on matters of sustainability and its reporting as an indirect approximation of the views of the stakeholders with whom it interacts.
This assumption is based on the fact that these groups have developed their lists of priorities in consultation with stakeholders and experts.
Reporting standards: the GRI publication  Sustainability Topics for Sectors  was used to identify the topics that are particularly important in the  Software and Services  sector, along with the aspects identified by SASB as relevant in the  Software and IT Services  sector.
ESG investment analysts: the company has applied the weightings allocated to each of the assessment criteria used by each of the analysts for the sector in which Indra is classified.
3.
Internal prioritisation based on consultations with managers: a survey was conducted among a representative sample of 178 managers   including corporate level, business and country-level managers   asking them their views on various issues relating to the importance of each potentially relevant ESG aspect identified: the impact on their business, society and the environment.
This was a marked improvement on the previous year, since significantly more directors were consulted (178 this year compared with 38 the year before).
This allowed Indra to conduct a separate materiality assessment for each of the main countries in which it operates, in line with the new EFRAG requirements.
4.
The double materiality perspective: the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) introduced the double materiality perspective in 2019, meaning that companies must report on how sustainability issues affect their business and the impact that the company s operations have on society and the environment.
In ESRS 1 and 2, EFRAG s proposed European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRSs) set out the methodology and requirements for materiality reporting.
5.
Identification of indicators: finally, for each material topic, Indra has identified the information and indicator requirements set out by the main reporting standards and ESG analysts, including Spanish Act 11/2018 and the GRI standards.
Sustainability Report 2022 103 Sustainability Report 2022 The list of material topics identifies the non-financial issues linked to the company s operations that significantly affect its performance and the decisions made by its stakeholders.
This year, Indra carried out separate materiality assessments for each of the main countries in which it operates (Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Italy and the Philippines).
Although there were slight variations between these countries in terms of their priorities, overall, the assessments were consistent in identifying topics related to information security, talent (including labour rights and professional development), corporate governance and innovation as those most significant for the company.
The materiality assessment was presented to the Sustainability Committee, which reports directly to Indra's Board of Directors, at its November 2022 meeting, to ensure that topics are also being prioritised as part of the decision-making process at the highest level.
Moreover, Indra's sustainability department, which was responsible for conducting the assessment, held meetings with the heads of the company's various management departments to inform them of the results of the assessment.
These meetings included a working session with the risk department to allow the findings of the materiality assessment to be incorporated into the company's overall risk management.
As a result of its materiality assessment, Indra identified the following issues as the ten most important for the company.

), or involve the management of key personal data (health, financial services, election processes, etc.
).
Indra s ISO 27001 certified Information Security Management System is responsible for defining, implementing and improving highly effective controls and procedures to minimise and manage the risks in the company s internal processes, in its daily operations, in the development and execution of projects, programmes and services and in client management.
For more information, see section 7.7.
Corporate governance: Although the decision-making process is equally important to all types of organisations, the regulator and the capital markets make greater demands of large listed companies such as Indra.
For example, Indra has to comply with the corporate governance requirements imposed by Spain s Law on Limited Companies, the Spanish National Securities Market Commission s (CNMV s) recommendations on good governance for listed companies, and the demands of international analysts and investors or proxy advisors, to list but a few.
The company therefore takes care to ensure that modifications are constantly being made to its internal regulations to bring them in line with best international practices and facilitate swift and efficient decision-making, benefiting all the stakeholders it interacts with.
For more information, see section 3.4.
Corruption and bribery: in the normal course of its business, Indra forms relationships with a large number of stakeholders in their capacity as clients, suppliers and shareholders.
With regards to these relationships, Indra rejects corruption and any illegal practice and makes a commitment to comply with the law.
The company s Code of Ethics and Legal Compliance defines what is meant by corruption and bribery, including the basis of the anti-corruption policy.
For more information, see section 4.1.
Human Rights: as a benchmark, the company acts in accordance with the international frameworks in matters concerning Human Rights, including the International Bill of Human Rights, the principles relating to rights set forth in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization, the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, of which Indra has been a signatory since 2004, and the UN s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Indra is committed to promoting responsibility and respect for Human Rights in all the company s actions, ensuring it does not infringe the rights of third parties and that it addresses the potential adverse impacts which may arise from its activity.
For more information, see section 4.2.
People Recruitment and talent retention: as a technology company Indra s employees are renowned for their high level of professional expertise and STEM qualifications (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
The jobs market often experiences a shortage of professionals with this kind of profile, which means that companies can encounter problems when it comes to attracting and retaining talent.
Indra therefore places great emphasis on managing culture and diversity to improve the commitment and retention of its employees.
For more information, please see sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4.
Professional development: the capacity to innovate, create solutions and offer customers the best service lies with the company s employees.
Having the talent that makes this possible depends on both the capacity to attract the best professionals in the marketplace and the ability to fully develop their potential within the company.
Indra s assessment model, Performance Experience, is an integrated and personalised model aimed at ensuring professional growth and development.
Indra also offers a 360  learning environment in which each person can receive training, however and whenever they wish, using the tools provided by Open University, Indra s own corporate university.
For more information, see section 6.3.
Sustainability Report 2022 105 Sustainability Report 2022 Employment conditions and rights: as a tech-based service company, Indra is a staff intensive company, and takes safeguarding its employees  fundamental employment rights extremely seriously.
Indra complies with the regulatory content of the International Labour Organization s (ILO) Collective Bargaining Agreements in relation to the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
As such, it works and liaises with workers  representatives in the company, providing them with a channel for dialogue and the adoption of agreements.
For more information, see section 6.6.
Planet Energy: The energy consumed by computer equipment and data processing centres means that the Information Technology sector is a major consumer of electricity.
Introducing renewable sources of energy and ensuring that processes and equipment are as efficient as possible is therefore key to mitigating the impacts of Climate Change, while also reducing the company's energy costs.
That is why Indra espouses a philosophy of continuous improvement in relation to optimising its technological infrastructure, processes and company culture.
In 2021, Indra decided to migrate its main data processing centres to the cloud.
The company also ensures that its IT equipment has energy certifications and encourages its professionals to use technology responsibly.
For more information, see section 5.3.
Impact Innovation: as a company that operates in highly competitive sectors with a strong technological component, innovation is one of the core principles of Indra's business model.
Innovation implies developing new skills to improve the activities related to the design, development and implementation of systems and processes.
Indra s innovation activities include research, the development of new products and the continual improvement of existing products.
For more information, see section 7.5.
Supply chain: the supplier management process aims to secure the best suppliers via procedures designed to ensure transparency and equal conditions for the various bidders.
Indra s relationship with its supply chain is based on a commitment to independence, transparency and compliance and the creation of long-term value.
For more information, see section 7.9.
Finally, it is also worth mentioning that between 2021 and 2022, Indra carried out an impact assessment of both its externalities as a company and those of its solutions and services.
This assessment provided it with an objective and quantifiable measurement in monetary terms of Indra s material topics that have an impact on people and the environment.

In accordance with the GRI Standards, information on the creation and distribution of economic value indicates how an organisation generates wealth for stakeholders.
Some components of economic value generated and distributed also reflect the economic profile of the organisation, which allows for the normalisation of performance-related figures.
The components of the indicator are: revenues, operating costs, employee wages and benefits, payments to capital providers, payments to government and community investments.
The economic value generated includes ordinary income and other income amounting to  3,904 million, corresponding to the financial year 2022.
On the other hand, the economic value distributed amounted to  3,669 million in 2022 and corresponds to: personnel expenses; accrued income taxes and levies; investment in social action; supplier expenses including consumption and other supplies and other operating expenses minus investments in social action and levies; financiers, which includes the financial result and the result of companies valued by the equity method.
The economic value retained by the company is the result of subtracting personnel expenses, taxes on profits and other taxes, social action, expenses on suppliers and financial backers from income.
Economic value generated, distributes and retained by Indra calculated according to GRI 201-1 Suppliers expenditure; 1,397,281 Taxes on profits and other taxes; 80,172 Clients; 3,903,998 Social Action; 1,351 Personnel costs 2,147,354 Note: figures in thousand euros Sustainability Report 2022 108 Sustainability Report 2022 11.5 EU Taxonomy Revenues Substantial DNSH criteria contribution Economic activities C ( so )d e T o ta l re v e n u e s P r er vo ep no urt eio sn o f m itig a tio nC lim a te C h a n g e a d a p ta tio nC lim a te C h a n g e m itig a tio nC lim a te C h a n g e a d a p ta tio nC lim a te C h a n g e a n d m a rin ep ro te c tio n o f w a te rS u s ta in a b le u s e a n d e c o n o m yT ra n s itio n to c irc u la r a n d c o n tro lP o llu tio n p re v e n tio ne c o s y s te m sb io d iv e rs ity a n dr o e fs to ra tio n P ro te c tio n a n d M in im u m s a fe g u a rd s 2 0 2 2a lig n e d w ith ta x o n o m yP ree vr ec ne un eta sg e o f 2 0 2 1a lig n e d w ith ta x o n o m yP ree vr ec ne un eta sg e o f ( /t ) re an na sb itl ii on ngC a te g o ry o f a c tiv ity M  % % % Y/ N Y/ N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N Y/N % % E/ T A.

Diesel C: in 2022 the consumption of Diesel C has increased due to the opening of the simulation centre located in Coslada (Spain) where a generator set is temporarily being used to supply energy to the centre while waiting for the transformation centre planned for 2023 to be commissioned.
The figures for Diesel C in 2022, excluding the consumption of this centre, are 26,805 l and 259.5 MWh respectively.
Sustainability Report 2022 113 Sustainability Report 2022 Natural gas: in 2022 consumption has increased due to the return to face-to-face work (in Spain the percentage of occupation of the centres has increased from 17% to 33% in 2021 vs.
2022) and consequently the change in the operating patterns of the work centres.
During 2021, the low presence of workers during the afternoon allowed the air conditioning to be switched off in unoccupied areas.
In 2022 consumption is close to 2019 levels.
Electricity: in 2022 electricity consumption has been reduced as a result of the Space Optimisation Plan and the changeover to coworking centres where there is no operational control over consumption.
Electricity from renewable sources: in 2022, the percentage of green energy in Spain has been increased (100%) and other geographies such as Chile (95%), Portugal (88%) and Australia (10%) have been included in the calculation.
Other energy sources: this concept includes the residual energy sources used in some facilities, in particular the urban heating and cooling network known as "Districlima" in the 22@ centre located in Barcelona (Spain).

Specifically, in 2019, Indra carried out a project to determine the most relevant Scope 3 categories for the company and measure those that apply to them.
As a conclusion of the analysis, Indra has identified that 81.2% of Scope 3 emissions are concentrated in three of the categories: acquisition of goods and services (59.0% of total Scope 3 emissions), business travel (15.2%), and commuting of professionals between home and work (7%).
As a result of the scope 3 emissions measurement project, Indra has also reviewed the criteria used to include certain energy consumption as sources of scope 1 and 2 emissions, to ensure that there are no relevant duplications or omissions in the measurement of the footprint.
In particular, Indra has reviewed those centres in which it has operational control and whose footprint should therefore be considered as scope 1 or 2.
In addition, in accordance with the GHG Protocol methodology, Indra has improved the measurement of its scope 1 emissions to include the fluorinated gases (HCFs) associated with its refrigeration equipment.
To ensure comparability of data, below is the 4-year history with the old methodology and the new one.
Note: in 2021, Indra, following the indications of the UNE EN ISO 14064-1 Standard: energy from the "Districlima" source has been reclassified as scope 2, as it is a source of heat originated by steam (this change represents a variation of 7.46 tonCO2e); the classification of vehicles with operational control assigned to work centres has been improved (this change represents an upward variation of less than 1% in scope 1 emissions in 2021).

For the calculation of Scope 1, the emission factors used for fuel consumption and fluorinated gases are DEFRA 2022 (UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2022 version 2) and those provided by the supplier for vehicles.
100% of the activity data used are primary data.
The emission factors used for the Scope 2 calculation are the energy mix emission factors for each geography published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) - location-based - and those provided by energy traders - market-based.

The pay gap has been calculated by comparing salaries between equivalent professional segments (same category, same business unit, same region/country).
In other words, it represents the percentage that women earn less than men, considering similar positions and responsibilities.
Professional segments in which there is not at least one female and one male employee are not included in this Sustainability Report 2022 121 Sustainability Report 2022 Indicators 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 calculation, which implies a real staff coverage of 90%.
For the calculation, fixed and variable salaries paid are considered.
Additional concepts such as: cash allowances, bonuses, long-term incentives, share-based remuneration, etc.
are not included.
Pay gap = [(Annual Salary + Variable Paid) Male - (Annual Salary + Variable Paid) Female] / (Annual Salary + Variable Paid) Female.
For more indicators on pay disaggregated by gender and age, see Annex 11.6 with the "Sustainability Indicator Table".

For the calculation, fixed and variable salary paid are considered.
Additional items such as: cash allowances, bonuses, long-term incentives, share-based remuneration, etc.
are not included.
For further indicators on remuneration broken down by gender and age, see Annex 11.6 with the "Table of sustainability indicators".
Scope of data 97% of total workforce at year-end.
(**) Note: the figure at management level in 2022 has been increased due to the departure in 2022 of the Managing Director of Minsait, who in the case of the gap was compared with other members of the Management Committee.
If this departure had not taken place, the salary inequality figure at management level would have been 15%.
(***) Note: the salary inequality in "other categories" in 2022 is a consequence of the incorporation of new companies into the company (e.g. 194 people from Teknatrans Consultores S.L.), as well as the massive incorporation of businesses such as BPO (e.g. 413 people in Indra Colombia S.A.A. and 225 in Indra BPO Mexico) imply a certain delay in the assimilation of employees into the company's roles.
Within these groups (especially acquisitions) salaries are very heterogeneous.

Specifically, these 7 countries correspond to around 93% of the total workforce at year-end.
The minimum entry salary is considered to be the average of the fixed salaries of the categories considered lower (technicians and support) in each country, as this is more representative than the minimum salary of a single person whose activity may not be representative of the activity carried out by the company.
