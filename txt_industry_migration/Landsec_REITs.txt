Since 2013/14, we ve reduced our carbon emissions by 52% and we re on track to achieve our target by 2030 despite a small increase in emissions compared to last year, which was largely due to occupancy and footfall gains across our assets from the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.

The increase has been largely due to occupancy levels increasing in our buildings and from the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.
Despite expected increases in carbon, reductions achieved from energy efficiency initiatives and changes in carbon emissions factors have prevented a higher yearly increase in carbon emissions.

Our updated energy intensity target is to reduce our energy intensity by 45% by 2030 compared with a 2013/14 baseline.
We have reduced portfolio energy intensity by 34% compared to our 2013/14 baseline.
Energy intensity has increased compared to last year largely due to occupancy and footfall having increased from the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.
While occupancy has increased, occupancy levels are still below levels before the start of the pandemic.
Furthermore, action was taken to extend the run time of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning services to minimise the risk of viral proliferation, leading to higher energy usage.
Therefore, energy performance still does not reflect normal building operation before the pandemic.
This chart shows the energy intensity improvements we have made since 2013/14 and the target energy intensity in 2030.

11 Landsec Sustainability Performance and Data Report 2022 Data Report Every year we report our full carbon footprint, including indirect emissions from our value chain activities (i.e. Scope 3 emissions).
By developing a full GHG emissions inventory, incorporating scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions, we re able to understand the total emissions associated with our business.
The GHG Protocol identifies 15 categories for scope 3 emissions of which 8 are directly relevant to our business.
The table below provides a breakdown of our entire emissions inventory.
Our scope 3 reporting methodology is detailed on p.38-44.

The chart below shows the largest categories.

Capital goods include the emissions associated with the manufacture and transport of materials used within our development activities and portfolio projects.
Downstream leased assets are those emissions associated with energy consumed by our customers within our assets.

Because both categories represent a significant proportion of our total carbon footprint, we are committed to understanding the impacts of our buildings as much as we can to ensure that we build and run them as efficiently as possible.
We therefore undertake lifecycle assessments on all of our development projects, following the RICS guidance document  Whole life carbon assessment for the built environment  1st Edition and BS EN 15978.
The assessment considers both the embodied carbon emissions from our supply chain and construction activities (stages A1 to A5), as well as anticipated emissions from a building s operations and embodied carbon associated with maintenance and repairs over the lifetime of the building (stages B1 to C4).
To minimise our construction impacts, we set targets on the embodied carbon emissions from supply chain (A1-A5) on a project-by-project basis, measured against design stage baseline (RIBA stage 3), and track these through to the completion of our buildings.
The table below shows that we ll avoid over 50,000 tCOe by targeting an overall reduction of 22.1% in the embodied 2 carbon across five developments.
We also carefully design our buildings to minimise the energy demand of our operations and meet the remaining demand through renewable electricity contracts.
This year, we have reviewed our embodied carbon targets for new developments.
In next year s report, we will focus on the overall embodied carbon intensity rather than the percentage reduction from design stage as a way of ensuring that we encourage structural retention and material reuse as much as possible on our new schemes.

In this profession in the UK, trade unions and collective bargaining agreements are not found.
Accordingly, although we would permit representation in a trade union were it applicable, we do not believe this to be necessary or applicable.
However, in our extended supply chains, some workers who engage in both skilled and unskilled labour are represented by trade unions.
This is typically found in construction, where employees are either self-employed or employed by suppliers who are two or more steps removed from us in the supply chain.
Our support for trade unions and collective bargaining is clearly outlined in our Human Rights Policy, which states that,  all employees have the right to join a union, bargain collectively and take action .

46 Landsec Sustainability Performance and Data Report 2022 Data Report Social Value Proxy Rationale Landsec is able to generate social value from those proxies which generate a financial value.
The table below highlights some of those proxies and provides a rationale how each is calculated: Table 34 Proxy Rationale Employment No.
of people (FTE) who are long-term unemployed (unemployed for a year Covers people employed as a result of a specific and deliberate employment initiative who were previously or longer) who have found employment through the programme claiming Jobseeker s Allowance (JSA) or Universal Credit unemployment benefits for at least the 12 months preceding the start of the employment contract and recruited as a result of a specific and deliberate employment initiative.
The proxy is derived from a combination of: (i) the average annualised increase in economic benefits to the individual over their lifetime; (ii) Annualised fiscal benefits to the NHS; (iii) Operational costs related to the fiscal benefit to DWP and HM Revenue and Customs.
The proxy is based on a generic JSA claimant.
No.
of homeless people (FTE) who are long-term unemployed (unemployed for Covers people employed as a result of a specific and deliberate employment initiative who were previously a year or longer) have found employment through the programme claiming Jobseeker s Allowance (JSA) or Universal Credit unemployment benefits for at least the 12 months preceding the start of the employment contract who are also armed forces veterans.
This is the proxy for long-term unemployed people employed (NT3) and is being used provisionally for this measure pending further research.
At procurement, the procuring organisation may use prioritisation weightings to signpost this measure to bidders.
See NT3 for the rationale.
No.
of mothers returning to work (FTE) who are long-term unemployed Covers people employed as a result of a specific and deliberate employment initiative who were previously (unemployed for a year or longer)   (when the mother is the primary carer) claiming Jobseeker s Allowance (JSA) or Universal Credit unemployment benefits for at least the 12 months who have found employment through the programme preceding the start of the employment contract who are also mothers returning to work.
The measure is directed at mothers   and not parents more generally   as it is aimed at redressing gender inequalities in the labour market resulting from the distribution of childcare responsibilities between parents.
This is the proxy for long-term unemployed people employed and is being used provisionally for this measure pending further research.
At procurement, the procuring organisation may use prioritisation weightings to signpost this measure to bidders.
No.
of 16-25 year-old care leavers (FTE) who have found employment through Covers people aged 18-24 and 16-17 who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET).
The measure the programme reflects costs and forgone benefits associated with being NEET, as follows: (i) the loss of earnings to the young person whilst NEET; (ii) benefit payments (worklessness and housing benefits) and foregone tax and national insurance receipts for the government.
Deadweight combines NEETs being unemployed with the benefits of coming off Job Seekers Allowance and/or Universal Credit SA-benefit for 18 24-year-old and for 16 17-year-old NEETs respectively.
The employment data is sourced from Stat-Xplore No.
of 18+ year-old people (FTE) who are rehabilitating or ex-offenders who Covers employees aged 18+ taken on who were in their rehabilitation period before the start of the employment have found employment through the programme contract.
The proxy value comprises (i) the value to the individual from entering the labour market (annualised increase in lifetime earnings); (ii) the fiscal value to the NHS resulting from an average reduction in health care costs associated with being out of work; and (iii) the economic, fiscal and wellbeing value to society from preventing reoffending.
All components are based on Unit Cost Database (UCDB) v2.0 figures, updated to 2020/2021 prices, and Ministry of Justice (MoJ) prevention of reoffending statistics.
A weighted average multiplier has been applied to reflect the ratio of estimated total number of crimes to the number of comparable crimes recorded by the police.
A further multiplier has been applied to the average number of offences per offender.
Deadweight is established separately to reflect the probability of reoffending.

Based on current equivalent economic benefit to the individual from equivalent increased earnings, based on minimum pay, given the distribution of apprenticeships achievements by age.
Charity Partnerships Money donated to charities The calculation for this is  1 donated for  1 of social value created.
Value of donations to charities Reported values of space and other donations to charities over the course of the financial year are based on metrics including Estimated Rental Value (ERV); commercial value of space; costs covered by Landsec like service charge, insurance and rates; the value of donated resources and goods; and reports received from charities and internal functions on the outputs of charitable appeals or campaigns.
Value of space donated to charities As above.
Volunteering Employability support for young people The proxy is based on the estimated economic value to the individual.
The value is derived from a 2021 sample of 16 pricing points from 9 different companies offering CV advice and job interview coaching, either in one-to-one sessions or one-day/half-day courses in small groups.
