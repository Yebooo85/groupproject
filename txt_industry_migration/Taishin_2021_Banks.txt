About Taishin 011 Impact Valuation and Measurement CONTENTS Sustainable Navigator Taishin FHC has adopted the profit & loss viewpoint for implementing corporate sustainability.
We integrated the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) management philosophy that takes into account the economic, environmental, and social impact and worked with academic institutions to jointly develop the "Impact Valuation and Measurement" model, which uses About Taishin the impact pathway approach to map out the positive and negative of value chain activities on the environment and society (called "externalities").
We monetized the impact to describe the potential impact on human wellbeing and the socio-economic, and demonstrated the substantive values created by company operations for stakeholders.
Company Profile The analysis results have shown that the external influence of Taishin FHC is mainly concentrated in the investment and financing activities downstream of the value chain, and its Business Performance influence accounts for more than 95%.
Due to investment, financing, and credit activities in 2021, the development of relevant industries was boosted, with an economic output Sustainability Highlights value of NT$1.119 trillion, and derived external environmental costs of NT$49.5 billion.
Faced with sustainability issues, Taishin FHC has continually focused on how to balance Impact Valuation and Measurement and expand the effects of sustainable investment.
Since 2018, Taishin FHC has gradually adopted the Green Finance Principles, the Equator Principles (EPs), and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) promoted by the UN, among other management mechanisms, in order to include the sustainability factors of the three major aspects of ESG into Awards & Honors investment and financing assessment processes.
In doing so, the company hopes to enhance the sustainability of the industrial chain and bring positive influence to stakeholders.
