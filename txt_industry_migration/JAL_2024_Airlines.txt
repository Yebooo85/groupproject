Significance of the JAL Group 17 Starting from a comprehensive understanding of social issues, the JAL Group analyzes risks and opportunities from a sustainability perspective, and continuously reviews its materiality based on the opinions and expectations of external stakeholders.
In 2023, the materiality was reorganized from the previous 17 Goals / 169 Targets of the SDGs, which were primarily addressed in the aviation business, to eight materialities that take into account new normal environmental changes and market changes.
These eight materialities are more closely linked to the creation of economic value in all JAL Group business areas, not just aviation, and that take into account the impact of our business on society in terms of both risk and opportunity.
Going forward, we will promote the penetration of the reorganized materiality within the company and realize value creation by promoting initiatives to address these materialities.

Strengthening Management Resources 89 Efforts to Reduce CO 2 in Ground Facilities and Vehicles Expand Use of Biodiesel Fuel (As of June 2024) The JAL Group has set a target of reducing unit energy B100 (100% biodiesel fuel) consumption in the ground facility field on average by one percent B30 (30% biodiesel fuel, 70% diesel fuel) or more.
Under the Operator Classification Evaluation System of New Chitose Airport/CTS Act on the Rational Use of Energy (Energy Conservation Act) B100 use (from 2023) implemented by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Oita Airport/OIT JAL Group has been certified as an excellent operator B100 use (from 2023) classification (S Class) for nine consecutive years since 2015.
We Nagasaki Airport/NGS are promoting initiatives to achieve the 2030 carbon half (indirect B100 use (from 2022) Narita Airport/NRT B100 use (from 2022) emissions) target, including further promotion of LED in facilities, introduction of air conditioning control systems, and purchase of Kumamoto Airport/KMJ non-fossil certificates (JAL SKY MUSEUM s exclusive areas are B30 use (from 2022) operated at practically net zero emissions).
Takamatsu Airport/TAK In addition, to reduce CO2 emitted by special vehicles at Miyazaki Airport/KMI B100 use (from 2024) airports, we are promoting the deployment of electrically B100 use (from 2023) powered special vehicles and the increased use of biodiesel fuel.
Starting with the trial at Kumamoto Airport, the JAL Group, in Tokushima Airport/TKS Naha Airport/OKA cooperation and collaboration with local communities and B100 use (from 2024) B100 use (from 2022) society, is successively using the biodiesel fuel, a locally Kochi Airport/KCZ produced, locally consumed, recycling-based energy, in airport Matsuyama Airport/MYJ B100 use (from 2024) vehicles (Kumamoto Airport: concentration 30 percent, other 10 B100 use (from 2023) airports: 100 percent concentration) at 11 airports across Japan.
(As of June 2024) In order to use special vehicles at Special Vehicles at Airports (powered by electrically or biodiesel fuel) airports, it is essential to expand airport infrastructure and collaborate with companies in the vicinity of airports.
The JAL Group will continue to promote the use of locally produced, locally consumed, recyclable energy at airports throughout Japan.

I expect her to be able to bring out new ideas and positivity from each employee.
MITSUYA President Tottori is demure, however as she has clear visions and beliefs, she is able to give her frank opinion without being too modest or aligning herself to others.
Regardless of her gender, I am sure that she will bring about good results to the management and overall organization.
YANAGI At the Nominating Committee, we focused not only on safety and peace of mind, but on being sensitive to creating new JAL-oriented value, specifically being responsive and thoughtful to our customers.
I am looking forward for President Tottori to be attentive in nurturing future-minded human resources who can develop new business domains in solution business and Mileage, Lifestyle and Infrastructure.
MITSUYA I agree with Mr. Yanagi about the importance in fostering human resources in the JAL Group.
I would like to see President Tottori more as a servant leader as she not a person who will pull the organization with strong leads but will walk with the employees and organizations where they will work together and encourage each other.
KOBAYASHI After our Group endured and recovered from COVID-19, we are now in the growth stage.
From a business structure that was focused on full-service carriers, we will now change our business structure with a balance in air transporta- tion and non-air transport services.
Thus, the most suitable person to become the president must be someone who has few constraints and is supported by all.
In this sense President Tottori is most suitable to be the president of the JAL Group.
