Since 2017, we have adopted the Total Impact Measurement and Management (TIMM) framework and Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis to assess the social impacts and operational risks of the company s business activities using monetary valuation tools.
In 2018, we began referencing the United Nation s  Integrating the SDGs into Corporate Reporting: A Practical Guide  to map out sustainable development goals (SDG) and sub-targets that need to be actively addressed.
In 2019, we used the SDG Compass Inventory of Business Indicators to examine the positive and negative impacts of our four major SDGs and the outcomes of our actions.
In 2020, we further applied sustainable value assessment used internally to the value chain so as to understand and analyze the impact of value chain activities on the environment and society.
In 2022, we associate the monetized outcomes of positive and negative impacts with significant issues.
This information will then be provided to the CSC to serve as references for the performing of weighing and comparisons in the value creation decision-making process.
By examining and analyzing the sustainability outcomes of actions by ASEH subsidiaries, we have been able to develop action plans and policies for improvements and reduce the impact of potential risks.
As such, we are able to fulfill our vision of promoting the United Nations  2030 SDGs via our own core competencies.

These standards allow the company to develop an impact-oriented materiality analysis framework to identify major sustainability issues.
In addition, we have incorporated major sustainability topics with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), that enables us to identify sustainability risks, and integrate them into the sustainability management process.
In addition to applying these principles to compile non-financial reports, they are also used as a basis for ASEH to formulate long-term sustainability objectives and strategies.
For the 2022 Sustainability Report, we collected the feedback of 2,642 stakeholders to gain insight into their level of attention to our efforts in addressing sustainability issues.
To measure the effects that sustainability issues have on our company operations, a 176-member team including subgroup CSC members led by ASEH senior executives in identifying the importance of each sustainability issue with regard to our company operations.
We selected 16 major issues which are the same as the selected issues for last year to be prioritized in driving corporate sustainability and setting long-term sustainability targets.
Step 1 : To identify relevant and important issues, ASEH referenced international standards & regulations, sustainable investment ratings and industry peers as well as stakeholder communications.
We Inclusiveness collected and organized 20 issues that are related to ASEH s sustainability issues.

and regular/occasional stakeholder communication to evaluate stakeholders' perception on sustainability issues.
Step 2 : In line with global sustainability reporting standards, ASEH uses the step-by-step guidance provided in the GRI 3: Material Topics 2021, to determine material topics based on stakeholder concerns, organizational and operational impact, and economy, environment and people impacts.
We consolidate and analyze stakeholder concerns through daily communication and surveys and seek out Materiality opinions from internal and external experts.
On the organizational and operational impact, and economy, environment and people impacts, we adopt the double materiality concept from the Draft European Sustainability Reporting Standards to assess the impact of sustainability issues within and outside of the organization.
The management and the team are invited to evaluate the impact of sustainability issues on the company's operations, focusing on the operational benefits linked to financial performance.
On the economy, environment and people impacts, ASEH performs a comprehensive impact valuation assessment annually and references the results of the RBA VAP to determine the significance of external impacts and decide on the gravity of sustainability issues.

Hedge adjustments were made to totally offset the foreign exchange gains or losses from those equity instruments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign operations when they were evaluated based on the exchange rates on each balance sheet date.
The source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships arose from the material difference between the notional amounts of borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and the fair value of investments in equity instruments denominated in foreign currencies and net investment in foreign operations.

1 The cost analysis of ASEH's renewable energy strategy is calculated from the base year of 2016, at an annual growth rate of 3% and the target to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050 OPERATING SUSTAINABLE INTEGRITY AND INNOVATION GREEN MANUFACTURING INCLUSIVE RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE APPENDIX 95 MODEL GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTABILITY SERVICE AND LOW-CARBON WORKPLACE PROCUREMENT CITIZENSHIP TRANSFORMATION Simulation Parameters for Scenarios Risk Description Category Corporate carbon tax is calculated based on different scenarios, and a high level of uncertainty exists due to significant differences in tax regulations.
Our assessment takes the following into consideration: Carbon tax 1.
Government s Net-Zero Pathway: Carbon tax of 300 NTD/tCO2e (approximately 10 USD/tCOe).
2 2.
SSP1-1.9 and SBT-NZ: Carbon price under SSP1-1.9 (around 650 USD/tCOe by 2050).
Regulation 2 Operational costs Currently, international regulations and trends lean towards implementing carbon taxes rather than relying on caps or penalties.
Caps and carbon penalties Therefore, additional consideration of the carbon penalty will be factored into the Government s Net-Zero Pathway (not exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,500 NTD/tCOe).
2 The cost of facilitating renewable energy in-house is a capital expenditure and is fully accounted for in the respective fiscal year.
The Cost of facilitating renewable energy Capital expenditure specific cost can be obtained from the IRENA Renewable Energy Report 2022.
Cost of operation for renewable energy The cost of operating renewable energy facilities can be obtained from the IRENA Renewable Energy Report 2022.
The cost of renewable energy procurement in Taiwan is the sum of Taipower s current average selling price of renewable energy and the public electricity fees (from Taipower).
Type of renewable energy Cost of procurement(NTD/kWh) Cost of procuring renewable energy Solar energy 5 Operational costs Offshore wind energy 4.5 Technology Onshore wind energy <30kW 3.6 Onshore wind energy >30kW 3.6 Cost of energy procurement from Taipower The cost and benefits of procurement from Taipower, calculated at a rate of 2.55 NTD/kWh for industrial high-voltage electricity.
According to data from IEA, the cost of CCUS varies according to circumstances.
Since this analysis considers carbon removal as the ultimate means to achieve net-zero, the most expensive technology of direct air capture is adopted, with costs ranging from 85 to 345 USD/tCOe.
The analysis is based on the following three scenarios: Carbon removal cost 2 - Immature technology: 340 USD/tCOe 2 Average price: 235 USD/tCOe 2 Mature technology: 130 USD/tCOe 2 Assumption Parameter 1 The calculation of market risks is based on the potential loss of market share due to company s failure to achieve its transition goals, which are of importance to certain customers.
Market Risk of market share loss 1.
Taiwan s Net-Zero Target (NDC): 1% of revenue loss Expected revenue 2.
SSP1-1.9 and SBT-NZ: 25% of revenue loss Assumption Parameter 2 This analysis assumes that 50% of the revenue is associated with low-carbon products.
Estimated Financial Impacts (1) Cost analysis of regulatory compliance for ASEH s Taiwan facilities In accordance with the Renewable Energy Development Act, ASEH s Taiwan facilities are 100 required to perform an assessment of renewable energy procurement or facilitating plans through 2030.
Included in the assessment is the cost of purchasing renewable energy and the 80 cost of reduced Taipower usage.
Results from the cost analysis indicated that it would require 60 an estimated expenditure of USD63-81 million to fulfill the procurement of renewable energy volume targets by 2030.
In addition, the estimated emission differences between the SSP1-1.9 40 and SBT-NZ transition scenarios indicate a gap that primarily stems from Scope 1 emissions.
Therefore, as part of ASEH s commitment to RE100, significant reductions in Scope 1 emissions 20 would be crucial to achieve SSP1-1.9 and SBT-NZ, particularly after 2040.

OPERATING SUSTAINABLE INTEGRITY AND INNOVATION GREEN MANUFACTURING INCLUSIVE RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE APPENDIX 100 MODEL GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTABILITY SERVICE AND LOW-CARBON WORKPLACE PROCUREMENT CITIZENSHIP TRANSFORMATION Towards Net-Zero Emissions In 2021, ASEH completed the validation of its near-term reduction targets, through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) which included targets to achieve verification of a 35% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from the baseline year of 2016 to 2030; and a target of 15% absolute reduction from the baseline year of 2020 to 2030 for Scope 3 emissions.
In response to global efforts to the 1.5 C pathway, ASEH revised its near-term targets and Net Zero 2050 targets, and submitted them to SBTi for review in 2023.
ASEH has established clear short-term, medium-term, and long-term carbon reduction targets; setting GHGs limits for subsidiary companies and manufacturing facilities, and implementing internal carbon pricing in stages based on the operating characteristics of each subsidiary.
Our approach helps to encourage greater action from the organization to reduce carbon emissions while boosting our resilience to external policy changes.
During 2022, ASEH s Kaohsiung and Shanghai sites successfully took the lead towards achieving the set targets, with plans to expand coverage by at least 80% by 2025.
In addition, we take strategic action in 5 key areas namely; investing in carbon credits, expanding the use of renewable energy and low-carbon transportation, developing low-carbon products, and supply chain engagement.
We are committed to continuously revise and update our targets, track and monitor the target progress.

In 2021, we established the  Renewable Energy Platform  to consolidate the energy procurement of all our three subsidiaries.
In addition, we managed to work with the value chain on the collective procurement of renewable energy, which not only increased the proportion of renewable energy used by our partners but also indirectly reduced greenhouse gas emissions overall.
In 2022, our total electricity consumption to talled 4,233,363 MWh, while electricity consumption decreased by 1% compared with 2021.
Although, we sold four facilities in 2022, we had also added new facilities and continued the expansion of production capacity at existing facilities.
As a result, the overall electricity consumption remained relatively unchanged compared to the previous year.
The electricity intensity per unit of revenue recorded a decrease of approximately 7% due to improved production efficiency.
In line with ASEH s commitment to the SBTi net-zero by 2050, we are progressively increasing the use of renewable energy through solar power (installed at our facilities), external procurement of renewable energy, and acquisition of RECs.
87% of our global facilities used electricity from renewable sources including RECs.

Procurement Management Raw Material Suppliers: For the first time procurement of chemicals or in the case of any changes, the unit managing the chemical material must counter approve.
All procured materials must comply with the local safety and environment regulations.
Engineering Contractors: Contractors undertaking high risk work must obtain the ISO 45001 certification.
To analyze the potential source of hazards and the underlying impact on the activities, products and services produced at each facility, we established a hazard identification and risk assessment system.
Every year, we conduct hazard identification on the physical, chemical, human, biological and psychological factors Risk Identification and that may lead to workplace accidents and illnesses.
We categorize risks according to their severity and frequency, and analyze the possible hazards to the work Assessment environment that may affect employees and implement the appropriate preventive measures.
If an unacceptably high risk is identified upon the assessment, improvement and regulation measures are carried out to ensure workplace health and safety.
To ensure the safety of workers and facility, we verify and assess each facility s management system and processes by conducting an internal audit.
On- site inspections are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of internal audit processes within the factory premises.
Detected deficiencies are added into the internal management system for monitoring and the audited unit is required to propose improvement measures.
These approaches are taken to gain a better Internal and External Audit understanding of the root causes of non-compliance issues, strive for continuous improvement, and ensure compliance with the requirements of the ISO 45001 framework.
